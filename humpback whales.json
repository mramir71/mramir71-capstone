He is guarding the mum and kid and waiting when she gets free again to be able to copulate again\n\n“The whales behave differently with humans – but never aggressive. Sometimes they just don’t notice you. The baby whales are very curious and try to play with you.\n\n**Please contact licensing@catersnews.com for media / licensing / broadcast usage**\n\nSUBMIT A VIDEO: https://bit.ly/2HWQ0mD\n\nConnect with Caters:\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/Caters_News\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/CatersTV\nWebsite: https://www.catersnews.com\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/caters_news/\n\nCompany Information:\n\nCaters Clips is owned and operated by Caters News Agency Ltd, an international multimedia content provider.

    "original": "Incredible Drone And Underwater Footage Of Humpback Whales\nSUBSCRIBE: http://bit.ly/Oc61Hj \nWe upload a new incredible video every weekday. Subscribe to our YouTube channel so you don't miss out:\n\n\nA British diver used a flying drone to capture incredible footage of humpback whales and their calves swimming off the coast of Tonga, in September 2014. The aerial camera shows a protective whale mother and her adorable calf as well as bull males chasing a female in an ocean mating ritual. Darren Rice, 47, moved from Crawley, West Sussex, five-years-ago to run a dive resort on the island of Foa in the Ha'apai region of the Kingdom of Tonga. The former underwater camera operator shot the footage during five hours over two days and flew the drone from a small boat driven by his wife Nina. \n\nVideographer / Director: Darren Rice\nProducer: Amanda Stringfellow\nEditor: Sonia Estal\n\nFor more compelling footage of the amazing side of life:\n\nFACEBOOK: Like Barcroft TV - \nhttp://goo.gl/7ayYgY\n\nTWITTER: Follow @Barcroft_TV - \nhttp://bit.ly/10vFLY9\n\nWEBSITE: For licensing & business enquiries, \nvisit the Barcroft Media site -\nhttp://bit.ly/19OYwp",

Following them are Orcas and Humpback whales, who are hunting together for herring with their individual \"special techniques\".\nOrcas are performing \"killer loops\" or „carousel feeding“ in which they swim fast into the shoal of herring, turn around their own axis and beat the fish with their tail. \nThe paralyzed fish then float in the water and are easy to pick up by the Killer whales or birds. The Humpback whales dive under the herring and taking a huge gulp while ascending. \n\nThis 4k + footage was shot around Vengsoya / Norway with drones and Underwater and is featured in the new BBC Blue Planet 2 series.\n\nPlease subscribe, if you like it!\n\nMusic: :  'Kreis' by James Richardson(kingjamesroyaltyfreemusic\n\nCameras: Panasonic GH4, DJI Phantom 4, Gopro 4, Red Epic (Underwater)\n\nFor licensing contact: mail@visualmondo.com",

    "original": "Seems like these humpback whales had a lunge date! Whale watchers in Monterey Bay were treated to a whale of a show yesterday, as over a dozen dashing diners took turns launching and lunching on anchovy antipasti! \n\nHumpback whales are here to gorge on the bounty of the Monterey Bay’s cool waters before heading down to warmer Mexican waters to breed. Their expandable throat pouches engulf gallons upon gallons of fishy seawater, before powerful tongues push the soup through mustache-like baleen, leaving only the finest of anchovy noodles behind these built-in pasta strainers.\n\nFun fact: Our whales are a different population than the humpbacks in Hawai'i, which migrate to Alaska and back.\n\nGo whale watching if you can! Late summer is a magical time of year in Monterey Bay.\n\n____\n\nWhale hello there! We hope you liked this video.

As we approached the feeding whales one humpback whale breached in front of us. We then turned off the engine and watched the whales. Within minutes two humpback whales approached our zodiac, and for the next half an hour they \"played\" with our boat, coming very close but with out touching or disturbing our little inflatable boat in any way. It was an amazing experience.",

Weather was abnormally warm and caused a lot of small fish to come near the shore and the humpback whales love to eat the school of fish.\n\nAlso look carefully at the seal who hangs out with whales, one of the scenes he is in between the whales.  Whales are so cool they love hanging out with seals and even protect them, best buds for life.\n\nP.S. I am trying to do my best voice over in BBC style.

    "original": "In Tonga, we got to experience one of the most amazing things we've ever done in our lives: swim with humpback whales.  We'd organized a tour with a local dive company (it's illegal to swim with them on your own) and got incredibly lucky as we found a mother, her calf and an accompanying male.  We probably spent an hour and a half in the water with them and the calf put on quite a show for us!\n\nAfter our whale swim, we spent another week enjoying Tonga with several boats who all had crews all under the age of 40.  Keep an eye out, you may see a few familiar faces!  ;)  We had a great time with the group I jokingly referring to as the \"Kid's Table Club\" but eventually the wind filled in enough that it was time for us to leave Tonga.  We had such a blast here that it was hard to leave!\n\nTo follow along with our cruising adventures, please subscribe to our YouTube channel and check out our blog and Facebook page:\n\nhttp://www.outchasingstars.com\nhttps://www.facebook.com/outchasingstars\n\nThanks for watching!\n\n(Footage from September 2016)\n\n\nMusic Thanks To:\n\nJim Yosef - Canary [NCS Release] \nYouTube Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52R3Xy82nFc\nJim Yosef\n• https://soundcloud.com/jim-yosef\n• https://www.facebook.com/jimyosefmusic\n• https://www.youtube.com/c/JimYosef\n• https://twitter.com/jimyosef\n\n\nPontus Engström - Universe [Outertone Release]\nLink: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HFMpzzphVOw\n\nFollow Pontus Engström:\nhttps://soundcloud.com/pontusengstr-m\nhttps://www.facebook.com/pontan.engstrom\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_ag...\nhttp://dj.beatport.com/https-soundclo...\nhttps://www.instagram.com/pontus__eng...\n\nFollow Outertone: \nWebsite: http://outertone.com\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/outertonemusic\nTwitter: http://twitter.com/outertonemusic\nSoundCloud: https://soundcloud.com/outertone",

We could hear his male \"singer\" whale singing through the hull of the canoe when he surprised us by jumping out in the air.  This was off the South West side of Maui by Olowalu. This location is perfect for guests staying in Lahaina and Kaanapali.  For guest staying in Kihei or Wailea that want to go whale watching our Makena location is closest.   The waters surrounding Maui's southwest shores are the most populated for humpback whales in the entire world during our whale season.

In November 2014, Neill travelled to Northern Norway on a trip to snorkel with orcas and humpback whales.\n\nThese amazing marine mammals congregate in a fjord each year in November (for now, patterns can change) and it's possible to get in the water with them which is a mind-blowingly brilliant experience. Cold, dark for much of the day but unbelievably beautiful both above and below the water. This really is the trip of a lifetime.\n\nWant to learn more about our luxury holidays?\n---------------------------\nNorthern Norway | http://www.originaldiving.com/europe/norway/northern-norway\nRead our blog | http://www.originaldiving.com/blogbook\nWebsite | http://www.originaldiving.com/\nFacebook | https://www.facebook.com/originaldiving\nTwitter | https://twitter.com/OriginalDiving\nPinterest | http://www.pinterest.com/originaldiving/",

    "original": "Whale Alert from Dana Point- Since Sunday 7/20 we have been seeing this spirited pair of Humpback Whales , along the shores of Dana Point, Laguna and San Clemente they are just going back and forth making Dana Point their home - we would love it if they stayed!  Kind of like a little Monterey Bay show off Dana Point, Capt Frank videoed this pair with both his Phantom 2 Copter cam and his Cannon camera , all the boats in this area are at a dead stop , because humpbacks are very friendly and like to approach better to stay put.. so our passengers can see what the whales look like above the surface and at the surface. Whale Watching passengers out with Dana Wharf got a rare treat of two flukes , both Mom and Calf fluking at the same time. The pictures are amazing and the video too\n\nCheck out our Whale Sightings Log updated daily http://danawharf.com/whale-watching/ \n\nAll footage including drone footage is owned by Dana Wharf Whale Watching and may not be used without permission.\n\nDana Wharf is the premiere year-round whale watching company in Dana Point. Beginning in 1971 we are the pioneer of whale watching adventures in Orange County, California. \nWe interact with over 1000 whales during the Gray whale migration in the winter and view hundreds of 90 feet Blue whales in the summer. Sightings of Orca, Humpback, Sperm and Finback Whales are not uncommon.\nIn addition to whales, thousands of dolphins, sea lions, sea faring birds and even sharks are found year-round in our waters, so we always have plenty of wildlife to see.\n\nDana Wharf Whale Watching\n34675 Golden Lantern, Dana Point, CA 92629\nPhone: 1-888-224-0603\nEmail: info@danawharf.com\nWeb: www.danawharf.com\nFollow us on instagram @danawharf\nTwitter @danawharf",

    "original": "Live webcam feed from the Hawaiian Islands Humpback Whale Marine Sanctuary off the island of Maui.  The Sanctuary, which spans all the way to the mysterious island of Molokai and Lanai in the distance, is the birthing and mating grounds of the North Pacific Humpback Whale population.  They can be seen breaching, fin and tail slapping in large numbers here from December to April.  This live feed rotates from north (tiny Mokuho'Oniki Island and Kahana, Maui), west (Island of Molokai) to south (Island of Lanai)\n\nJust in front is the Kahekili Marine Reserve - one of only three conservation zones on Maui and a popular spot for watching green sea turtles feed on seaweed.  Spot the occasional pod of dolphins or a rare sighting of the critically endangered Hawaiian Monk Seal.   Morning rainbows are common and the sunsets in the evening are spectacular.\n\nThis is the exact view that guests of Maui Sands Unit 4B experience right from the ground floor lanai.  Unit 4B is a carbon neutral,  eco-friendly and fully-equipped condo.  Maui Sands is one of the original condo resorts in all of West Maui and it has retained a lot of the old Hawaii vintage feel of the 60's before the hotel boom.    If you would like to experience this view in person, visit http://www.mauisands.com to find out more.\n\nThe researchers at the Hawaiian Islands Humpback Whale Marine Sanctuary at NOAA has asked for your help in spotting Humpback Whales. Specifically, they want our viewers to report anything unusual with the Humpbacks such as vessel strikes, entanglements etc. If you spot a humpback and more importantly see one in distress, please make note of the day and time (time on the bottom left of video) and email the details to whalesighting@mauisands.com. We will forward your report right away to the Maui Island coordinator at NOAA.\n\nIf you spot any other marine creatures such as Hawaiian Monk Seals, Spinner Dolphins or Sea Turtles (Green or Hawksbill) feel free to report it in the live chat.  \n\nChat Rules: English only, no retractions please.",

    "original": "Whale watchers aboard a catamaran with Captain Dave’s Dolphin and Whale Safari were viewing a humpback whale when they noticed that the whale seemed to be playing with a shrimp trap buoy located about 2 and 1/2 miles off the coast of Dana Point, California. Several minutes later the whale dove down and entangled itself around the tail.\n\nFor several nail-biting minutes the humpback whale thrashed violently to remove the line, tossing the line and buoy high into the air. Eventually the animal managed to snap the polypropylene line and free itself from the entanglement to rowdy cheers. One passenger even cried with relief. \n\n“I have never seen a whale as dangerous as that whale was when it was thrashing around. I wouldn’t have wanted to be anywhere near it.  I happened to have my high-speed camera and I filmed at 240 frames per second the very last violent maneuver this whale did when it freed itself,” said Captain Dave. I was so relieved for the whale and myself as it meant I did not have to spend the rest of the day out on the water trying to free this ticked off whale with our local Whale disentanglement group, the OC Whale Rescue Team! Everyone on all three whale watching boats cheered it was one of the most beautiful moments I have ever had on the water!”\n\nNearly 1,000 dolphins and whales worldwide die every day because of fishing gear entanglement. In 2015 over 50 entangled whales were seen off the coast of California according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, (NOAA).  Captain Dave helped organize Orange County's first whale disentanglement group in 2008.\n\nOne shrimp trap buoy has a series of up to 12 traps laid out on the bottom of the ocean with weights in between each trap. If the whale had not broken free it would have been hard, if not impossible, for the whale to go very far dragging all that gear. It appears that all the line was removed. It’s unknown at this time if the animal sustained any serious injuries to the tail.\n\nHumpback whales were once a rare sighting off of Dana Point. Since 2014 they have been seen in record numbers.  Humpback whales are known for their playfulness and easily recognized by their long pectoral flippers. They filter up to 3,000 pounds of food, usually krill or small fish, through plates of black baleen that hang from the top of the upper jaw. Humpbacks reach about 50 feet in length and weigh up to 40 tons. \n\nIn addition to humpback whales like the one in this video, huge numbers of migrating gray whales are being seen off the coast of Southern California right now. In a span of just four days, Captain Dave’s Dolphin and Whale Safari’s excursions have had 150 encounters. The next two weekends Dana Point Harbor will celebrate gray whales and other marine wildlife at the 45th annual Festival of Whales. Ocean-themed events and activities that have an emphasis on education and environmental responsibility are planned for the two-weekend festival.\n\nCaptain Dave exclaimed, “I saw 26 gray whales during my first trip today. A personal record!”\n\n\nAll audio and video footage is copyright David Anderson/DolphinSafari.com and may not be used without permission.\n\n*****\nCaptain Dave's Dolphin and Whale Watching Safari offers daily, year-round, dolphin and whale watching trips from Dana Point, California, aboard a hi-tech catamaran sailboat with Eye-to-Eye Underwater Viewing Pods.\n\n(949) 488-2828\ncaptaindave@dolphinsafari.com\nhttp://www.dolphinsafari.com\nhttp://www.facebook.com/dolphin.whale.watching\n\n*****",

She sent her drone out to film immediately whilst I prepared mine for take off. Both drones had polarising filters on them, tho differing NDs. \nThe whale was swimming at some pace and it was not long before we had reached our legal limit for distance so had to stop.\nI have edited this video with some of the footage I took prior to the whale arriving and you too can see how beautiful the surroundings are.",

    "original": "Michael Fishbach, co-founder of The Great Whale Conservancy (GWC), narrates his encounter with a young humpback whale entangled in local fishing nets.\n\nAt first, the animal appeared to be dead, yet Fishbach investigated and quickly discovered that the poor creature was tangled in a fishing net.\n\nThe humans had to act fast; what began as a tragedy soon became a thrilling rescue as Fishbach and his crew labored to free the young whale.\n\nThe entire encounter was caught on videotape and later narrated by Fishbach himself.\n\nWatch as the whale named Valentina by her rescuers goes from near death to freedom, then rewards her saviours with dozens of magnificent full-body breeches and tail flips.\n\nIndeed, this video has the power to inspire action on behalf of other beings. In ways big and small, each of us can be the one who helps another.\n\nOpportunities to be a hero for animals are all around.\n\nPlease check out http://www.eii.org/gwc/ for more great information on Great Whale Conservancy\n\nFull story on this awesome rescue here http://wakeup-world.com/2011/07/17/whale-shows-amazing-appreciation-after-being-freed-from-fishing-nets/",

    "original": "On Sunday afternoon, about eight miles off the coast of Dana Point, our whale watching vessel operated by Captain Tom encountered an entangled humpback whale.\n\nWhen our boat first found this whale, it was obviously very stressed and it was doing tail slashes. The whale did over 100 tail slashes, a violent maneuver as seen in the video. \n\nIt was most likely trying to remove the remainder of the gear, or maybe it was feeling a lot more freedom from having had some of that gear removed earlier in the day. Captain Tom told me that he could see rope wrapped around its body and trailing behind it, although it was hard to tell if the whale still had rope wrapped around it or if they were scars from the entanglement. We definitely know it still has some rope attached.\n\n*****\nCaptain Dave's Dolphin and Whale Watching Safari offers daily, year-round, dolphin and whale watching trips from Dana Point, California, aboard a hi-tech catamaran sailboat with Eye-to-Eye Underwater Viewing Pods.\n\nTel: (949) 488-2828\nWeb: http://www.dolphinsafari.com\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/CaptDavesWhaleWatching\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/captdaveswhalewatching/\n\n*****\n\nDolphin and whale footage is copyright David Anderson/DolphinSafari.com and may not be used without permission.",

    "original": "A Wildlife guide and photographer to polar destinations sharing his passion for nature. Learn about the wildlife and how to be a better nature photographer. This Pagophilia vlog takes you swimming with whales in the fjords of Norway. Here, Humpback whales sometimes follow the Orcas hunting for Herring (a type of fish) and let the Orca do all the work gathering the Herring but the Humpback then come and steel their food. Another technique is that Humpbacks push the Herring towards the shore and very shallow water. This traps the Herring and the Humpback can feed without the Herring has any escape routes. Sometimes it is so shallow that there is barely enough water for the Humpback to swim - let alone for a Humpback and a snorkeller like myself. Watch this extraordinary film and learn about the Humpbacks and the Orcas visiting the fjords of Norway during a few short winter months.",

    "original": "We were watching over 1,500 dolphins of two species; Pacific White-Sided Dolphins and Northern Right Whale Dolphins. The second type are rare to see except we see them periodically in Monterey Bay due to deep water so close to shore. Theses dolphins are unusual and are shaped like torpedoes, have no dorsal fin, and are all black with a white underside. On this day they had some small gray calves with them. This large school of dolphins encounters a mother and calf Humpback Whale and some dolphins began to “snout ride” of them. That’s when dolphins, which are very playful and intelligent, annoy the Humpbacks a bit by buzzing around their head and causing the large whales to move quickly forward allowing the dolphins to surf off the wave created by the whale’s head. The dolphins seem to really enjoy this and the whales aren’t really bothered. The Humpback calf was born in Mexico about 4 months ago and now he’s here with mom in Monterey Bay to learn how to catch fish and krill. In this case the little whale is experiencing the excitement of swimming around hundreds of dolphins! For Use Must Ask and Credit Monterey Bay Whale Watch/ Gowhales.com (Video by Jason Berring)",

    "original": "Wednesday 05/23/2012\nEvening Whale Watching Quest:\n\nThis video has more real time (be there) feel as I left some of my running footage in the video.  I wanted you to sense how much I was scrambling and how excited I was to record these whales :-))\n\nThe following text is from the Holland America Alaska shore excursion listings:\n\nEnjoy a magical evening cruise that features guaranteed whale viewing and great food. Following a short motor coach ride to scenic Auke Bay, you'll board a deluxe catamaran specially designed for wildlife viewing. Relax in the warm, spacious main cabin as you set out to explore Stephens Passage, a pristine marine wilderness surrounded by snow-capped peaks and glaciers. This area is world-renowned as a favored summer feeding ground for humpback whales. As whales are sighted, your skilled captain will gently maneuver the vessel to allow exceptional viewing opportunities. You'll be amazed by the gracefulness of these ocean giants as they slowly arc their massive tail flukes into the air. The whales are often close enough to hear them breathe. If conditions allow, an underwater hydrophone will be deployed so that you can experience their incredible \"singing.\" An on-board naturalist will explain the behavior and habitat of the humpback whale, and other wildlife you may encounter, including killer whales (orcas), sea lions, porpoise, harbor seals and bald eagles. Throughout the voyage you'll be treated to a delicious variety of appetizers including a baron of beef, reindeer sausage, smoked salmon, cheese and vegetable trays, hot shrimp dip, dessert bars and pastries. Tea, coffee and cocoa will be served. Beer, wine and sodas are available at an additional charge. The operators of this tour guarantee you will see a whale. If not, you'll receive a $100 cash refund as you disembark the tour vessel. In the past ten plus years, whales have been sighted on every tour\n\nhttp://www.allenmarinetours.com/sightseeing/juneau/tours/whale-evening/index.html\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?&v=jtPocg2nSII\n\nVideo was recorded with Canon ELPH 100 HS and Canon SX130 IS cameras.",

    "original": "Beautiful drone video of a humpback whale mother and calf. The whales 'blow rainbows' and give 'a wave' with it's tail.\n\nA dramatic increase of humpback whale sightings off the coast of Dana Point, in Southern California, is causing excitement among whale watchers and tour operators alike. According to our we've had 42 encounters with humpbacks so far this month, compared with just 4 last January.\n\nDana Point’s whale watching industry started many years ago with the gray whale migration. And Dana Point locals and visitors know January to be a great time to view gray whales making their annual journey from waters near Alaska to the lagoons of Baja, Mexico. And now it seems as though humpback whales want in on the fun, too! Humpback whales can be seen near Dana Point throughout the year.\n\nHumpback whales are migrating from their mating and calving grounds near Mexico and Central America to Dana Point to feed on krill and small schooling fish. The whales filter up to 3,000 pounds of food per day through plates of baleen that hang from their upper jaw. Humpback whales can weigh up to 40 tons and are well known for their incredible and acrobatic surface behaviors such as breaching and tail slapping.\n\nFilmed by Grayden Fanning\n\n*****\nCaptain Dave's Dolphin and Whale Watching Safari offers daily, year-round, dolphin and whale watching trips from Dana Point, California, aboard a hi-tech catamaran sailboat with Eye-to-Eye Underwater Viewing Pods.\n\nTel: (949) 488-2828\nWeb: https://www.dolphinsafari.com\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/CaptDavesWhaleWatching\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/captdaveswhalewatching/\n\n*****\n\nDolphin and whale footage is copyright David Anderson/DolphinSafari.com and may not be used without permission.",

    "original": "While on a whale watching tour off the West Side of Oahu, HI we saw a pod of about 7 humpback whales. This was towards the end of whale season and were told it was \"last call at the bar\". Most of the single whale females had started to head back to Alaska, but the few that were left were being heavily pursued by the males. After watching them come up to the surface for air a few times it was neat to sometimes see the tail flip up out of the water. It was an exciting morning, but we were all a little disappointed that none had breached. We started to head back, and that's when we noticed they had started to follow us, and had one final goodbye... Make sure to check out 1:15 - 1:45\n\nThe amazing tour we took was \"Best of the West\" at sailhawaii.com",

    "original": "Humpback whales are one of the most massive and beautiful creatures on earth. They come to Tonga in July through October to mate and to have their babies in a safe environment where there are no predators. The conditions are ideal and the mothers feed their calves massive amounts fo milk so they will grow rapidly. They will need their size and strength for the long journey to northern waters where they feed. Bulls, or male humpbacks, also come to Tonga and they will follow females and calves for weeks, providing an escort and added safety for the pair. But they are also waiting and hoping for a chance to mate with the females. Their protectiveness is only partially out of desire to keep her and the calf safe. It is also motivated by a desire for an opportunity to reproduce. When a female humpback is ready to mate, males will follow and even chase her, competing with each other for the rights. These pursuits often involve six or seven males swimming at full speed, acting very aggressively as they thrash and bump each other. Occasionally, they inflict serious injury on each other in the process. They are 60 ton animals and their hormones are raging. They have little restraint and a lot of drive as they struggle ferociously to impress the female. These behaviors are thrilling and fascinating to watch from a boat. These swimmers are enjoying a snorkel in the shallow waters near an island in the Tongan waters. They have been watching the whales from the boat and looking for a chance to actually swim with a whale. Now, during a break for lunch, they are looking at coral and fish along the reef. It is the last place you would expect to see a humpback whale. But the whales came crashing through like a herd of wild elephants. The female led the pack and nearly struck two of the swimmers. They saw her coming in time to swim backwards and out of the way. The laws here, as well as common sense, require that people avoid getting closer that 5m or 15 feet to the whales. Ethical guides such as the one on this tour will strictly enforce these rules and make sure that guests understand. But it is impossible to control the behavior of the whales and it is possible that they will not respect the same distance. The swimmer filming this incredible event looked to his left to see a 55 foot humpback bearing down on him in water that was barely deep enough for the whale to squeeze through. He was floating at the surface, about 15 feet off the coral and there was nothing to do but tuck in his arms and legs. The whale seemed to realize he was about to collide with a helpless person and he slowed abruptly, twisting and almost scraping the coral with his belly. The bull swam directly under him and missed by inches. This gentle giant actually made very slow and careful strokes with his tail until he was clear of the swimmer. He then accelerated with much bigger tail strokes and rapidly took off after the pack. A total of seven whales barged past these surprised swimmers. These incredible creatures have much greater intelligence and compassion than we have ever given them credit for. Sadly, some countries are still hunting and killing these magnificent animals. The Tongan people can teach us a lot about respecting the whales and the environment. The humpbacks also provide the Tongans with much needed revenue through tourism as people travel here to experience their beauty in their natural world. To lose these whales would be beyond tragic.\n\nSource & embed code: https://rumble.com/v7zuvn-gentle-humpback-whale-on-heat-run-shows-remarkable-compassion-for-swimmer-i.html.\n\nFor licensing, please email licensing@rumble.com.",

    "original": "I have been waiting all year for humpback whales as they migrate from Mexico to Alaska during summer months.  The last 3 days was the hottest weather here in Northern California, which caused many school of fish to move closer towards the coast.  Humpback whales tend to follow their meals and I spotted hundreds of humpback whales about a mile off the coast.  I really love these whales, they are so huge and lovely creatures.\n\nI used my Mavic 2 Pro.   It is actually REALLY HARD to take shots of these humpback whales as the waters here in Northern California are very muddy and the whales will disappear completely once they go under water.  This is about 6-8 hours of flying trying to catch them when on the surface so please hit the thumbs up as it was a LOT of flying, thanks!\n\nAll the shots are off coast of Pacifica, California where I live, if you want to capture some whale shots, fly towards the ocean about a mile out when the weather is warm.    When weather is cold, the humpback whales won't be easy to spot as they will be further in the ocean.\n\nHow big are these humpback whales?

The whale beached close to the Seward Highway, so the animal won’t go to waste and its blubber will be used by members of various Alaska Native groups. The location also enables biologists access for collecting tissue and organ samples.",

    "original": "At least 16 humpback whales harassed 11 killer whales after the killer whales killed a gray whale calf in Monterey Bay, CA. Although the calf died within a few minutes after we arrived, humpbacks  continued to harass the killer whales for over 6 hours:  could they have been trying to protect the dead calf? NEW RECORD: This  is the longest known interaction between feeding killer whales and mobbing humpbacks. The tightly grouped humpbacks made loud trumpeting sounds, rolled and slashed their pectoral flippers and flukes, and closely approached (and even chased) the killer whales. The humpbacks were still interacting with the killer whales when we left them near sunset. \n\nFilmed by killer whale researcher Alisa Schulman-Janiger (California Killer Whale Project) from the Point Sur Clipper (Monterey Bay Whale Watch) on 3 May 2012. With Captain Nancy Black (killer whale researcher) and deckhand/videographer Mike Merlo.\n\nLink: Please see Candace Calloway Whiting's September 2015 Huffington Post story \"Humpback Whales Intervene in Killer Whale Attacks on a Baby Gray Whale, and Save Seals\", for photos and more details about humpback whales interfering with killer whales - both in this encounter and in a killer whale attack on a seal in Antarctica (documented by NOAA scientists Bob  Pitman and John Durban). Neuroscientist Dr. Lori Marino shares her opinions about these encounters; she is a renowned expert in the cognitive ability of whales and dolphins.\nhttp://www.huffingtonpost.com/candace-calloway-whiting/humpback-whales-intervene_b_8093080.html",

    "original": "Dedicated to \"STELLWAGEN BANK NMS\"  Sept 2014\n \nSpecial thanks to the Captain Jeff Eagan,the crew members: Tasia Blough-Naturalist & Photographer, Don Johnson, Larry McNamara, the remaining crew members & visitors on the boat named “AURORA” of the New England Aquarium Whale Watch from Boston, MA. telephone 617-973-5206. www.neaq.org\n\nFor my family & in loving memory of my husband Arthur David Belden-Naturalist.\n\nby:Michelle Belden–Naturalist-Texas- mbelden50@yahoo.com.\nVideo duration: 14.56 minutes Please enjoy the video.                                                                                                                          \n\nEvery year the humpback whales migrate in the Atlantic Ocean from the Maritime Provinces of Canada, pass through Maine, Massachusetts, New York, Florida, Cuba and the Dominican Republic.  They feed out of the Stellwagen Bank National Marine Sanctuary down to the Silver Bank Sanctuary for Marine Mammals. The Stellwagen Bank National Marine Sanctuary is an underwater plateau in the Atlantic Ocean surrounded by the Gulf of Maine, Massachusetts Bay and Cape Cod Bay. The Silver Bank Sanctuary is also, an underwater plateau located in the Caribbean Ocean near Samana Bay and is a territory of the Dominican Republic. Both of these Sanctuaries are enriched with biodiversity, abundant schools of fish and plenty of krill, anchovies, cod, herring, pollock and capelin for the vigorous appetite of a baleen feeding marine mammal.\nThe New England Aquarium out of Boston, Massachusetts runs cruises to enrich our lives and educate the public to see the endangered Humpback Whales at the Stellwagen Bank NMS.  On September 23, 2014 my sister and I boarded the catamaran named “AURORA” and left the Boston harbor. It was a sunny day, calm seas and the wind favorable.  It took 1 hour to travel 35 miles off the mainland to the southwest corner of Stellwagen Bank NMS region which is north of the Cape Cod Bay. Everyone on the boat was engaged in watching humpback whale behavior.\n1. We saw humpback whales “Spouting” which is spraying water and breathing through their blow hole. \n2.  “Logging” on the surface of the ocean, which is a state of whales resting or sleeping in the surf. \n3.  “Breaching” was seen in the distance. This is when the entire power of the whale propels out of the surface of the ocean and slams back down into the depths of the sea.\n4.  “FLIPPERING” activity which is when they slap their pectoral flippers on the surface of the ocean making a loud splashing sound.\n5.  “SPYHOP” which is when the humpback whale peeks only their head and eyes out of the water and look briefly, turning their heads to the right and left, and then disappear back into the ocean. \n6. “FLUKE-UP and “FLUKE-DOWN” is when the humpback whales expose their tails at the surface of the ocean going into a dive. \n7.  “LOUD TRUMPETING” is when the humpback sprays from their blowhole and making a loud sound. It is interpreted this type of sound maybe communicating tension or anxiety. \nWhile we were all involved in watching these outstanding marine mammal behaviors, the unexpected gift was given to our boat the “AURORA” to witness. We saw a group of five whales swimming together, breathing, spouting, trumpeting, fluke diving, and each one made their presence known. Each one gracefully descending into a deep dive.  Each Humpback whale did a progressive dive into the depths of the ocean; we watched the first as it exposed it’s fluke and then dive. The second, the third, the fourth and the very last one, which was the fifth whale, did it’s last descending dive into the ocean. Everyone on the boat cheered, the captain sounded the horn for the finale of a great moment. What a memorable encounter with the endangered humpback whales. We saw 12 humpback whales this exceptional day. \n\nAdded Commentary from Naturalist Tasia Blough from the New England Aquarium: “The whale called “Habanero” was the first whale we saw in a whale behavior state called logging.  “Habanero” is female and was born to a whale named “Pepper”  in the year 2000. “Pepper” was one of the first two whales cataloged in the world named “Salt” and “Pepper”. The breaching whales were “Northstar” and “Hatchmark”. The whale named “Northstar” has a relatively a fresh wound on his back, likely due to a vessel strike from the summer. The group of whales swimming beside the boat named Aurora, was “Milkweed” and her calf, “Perseid” and her calf, “Storm” and “Pleats”.  The whale named “Pleats” also has laceration scars down its back from a vessel strike.”\n\nThe New England Aquarium Whale Watch  and Boston Harbor Cruises are participating companies in “Whale SENSE” program that have high standards in practices of viewing whales, providing education,ocean stewardship & conservation-www.whalesense.org",

This group hung together for a couple of hours.\n\n\"I always think it’s amazing to see hundreds of animals working together to feed upon millions of fish.

He came back by a few times, but the camera wasn't ever facing the right way except this first shot and although he got even closer I somehow knew he would never hit me. I assumed it was a humpback...anyone confirm? Three weeks ago I was visiting a location where I witnessed whales drowning in sharks nets, placed along the shore of the Kwazu Natal Coast. Now that I'm back in California it's hard to believe such irrationally contrived death traps actually exist.

    "original": "This was perhaps the coolest of our encounters (so far!) with humpback whales on the Great Barrier Reef during our 2018 research programme. Amazing what you can do with a GoPro camera!\n\nSome humpback whale populations are doing great, others not so much. The population of humpback whales on the East Coast of Australia is increasing at about 11% per year! That's huge. Other populations in the South Pacific aren't doing so well. Among other things, we're trying to determine if the humpback whales seen on the east coast of Australia mix with those in the South Pacific and whether or not they should be managed as separate populations. Pretty fundamental and important stuff. \n\nIf you'd like to be part of our research programme as a research assistant, visit our website www.blueplanetmarine.com. \n\nAll data were collected under permits issued by the Australian Government and in accordance with our animal ethics approval.",

    "original": "Whale watchers out with Captain Dave's Dolphin and Whale Safari in Dana Point, California, got more than they bargained for when a friendly juvenile humpback whale repeatedly swam next to and under the whale watching catamaran. This is called a mugging. The humpback whale mugged the boat so much that the Captain couldn't leave! The muggings occurred throughout the day, on every trip, and other boats gathered nearby to watch this amazing spectacle.\n\nPrior to 2014, Dana Point was well known for gray whale and blue whale watching. Southern California hosts the largest population of blue whales in the world during the summer months. Humpback whales were only seen occasionally, but within the last year sightings have increased exponentially, including a humpback that took up residence in the area for a couple of months last year. \n\nLike other baleen whales, humpback whales feed in colder waters and migrate to warmer climates for mating and calving. Humpbacks are seen off Southern California at sporadic times throughout the year when the whales are making their way up the coast in search of food or heading south to Mexico to mate and give birth. About 800 humpbacks are found off California in summer, mostly above Point Conception. \n\nHumpback whales can reach lengths of around 50 feet with females being slightly larger and they can weigh up to 40 tons. Their long pectoral flippers can be up to 15 feet in length. Humpbacks eat small fish and krill.\n\n\nAll audio and video footage is copyright David Anderson/DolphinSafari.com and may not be used without permission.\n\n*****\nCaptain Dave's Dolphin and Whale Watching Safari offers daily, year-round, dolphin and whale watching trips from Dana Point, California, aboard a hi-tech catamaran sailboat with Eye-to-Eye Underwater Viewing Pods.\n\n(949) 488-2828\ncaptaindave@dolphinsafari.com\nhttp://www.dolphinsafari.com\nhttp://www.facebook.com/dolphin.whale.watching\n\n*****",

    "original": "Captain Dave Anderson of Capt. Dave's Dolphin and Whale Safari in Dana Point, California, has recently filmed and edited a brand new video that contains never-before-seen footage of a mother and calf humpback whale being escorted by a sea lion. The mother and calf pair has been staying in the Dana Point area for a week now. \"At first I thought the sea lion was a dolphin, but was surprised to discover that it was, in fact, a sea lion bow-riding on the the mother's forward thrust.  As we watched the mother and calf we saw another startling behavior that I had never seen before.  The mother actually extends her left pectoral flipper towards the calf for several minutes...and then, just before a dive, touches the calf's chin, as if to lift it's head or blow hole out of the water to exhale before diving. I've never seen anything like it. It's like a human mother who is holding her child's hand. Without the drone's perspective, we would not have been able to see this interaction between the mother and calf. It was just beautiful and I was really moved to see the mother do this.\"\n  \nAccording to N.O.A.A. Southern California has the greatest density of dolphins in the world. We have pods up to 10,000 strong stretched out for miles like the wildebeests of Africa. Over 400,000 common dolphin alone. We also have the largest concentration of blue whales on earth.\n\nEntanglement in fishing gear takes the lives of nearly 1,000 dolphins and whales ever day around the world. Captain Dave formed Orange County's first whale disentanglement group in 2008 and has been involved in disentangling several whales, including a gray whale named Lily, whose disentanglement in Dana Point Harbor made national headlines. He authored the award-winning book, \"Lily, A Gray Whale's Odyssey\", which won eight awards in 2013.\n\nSpecial Note From Captain Dave:\n\nAttention any would be whale videographers: please only attempt this if you are extremely familiar with whale behavior as it is illegal to do anything that causes the whales to change their normal behavior with big fines- and the authorities do watch YouTube. Different areas have different laws on approaching whales. I am a whale watch captain with nearly 20 years of experience. All laws were obeyed by us during filming. The Mom and calf as you can see in the film were completely undisturbed by the small drone. NOAA is currently reviewing drones and may create laws or guidelines for using them around whales.\n\nFully licensed music by David Hollandsworth http://davidhollandsworth.com/\n\nVideo footage is copyright David Anderson/DolphinSafari.com and may not be used without permission.\n\n*****\nCaptain Dave's Dolphin and Whale Watching Safari offers daily, year-round, dolphin and whale watching trips from Dana Point, California, aboard a hi-tech catamaran sailboat with Eye-to-Eye Underwater Viewing Pods.\n\n(949) 488-2828\ncaptdave@cox.net\nhttp://www.dolphinsafari.com\nhttp://www.facebook.com/dolphin.whale.watching\n*****",

The real skill was thanks to Nick Masset who we were privileged enough to go out with. He has been studying and documenting the humpback whales off the Dingle peninsula for the last ten years through land based watches and photo id by rib. We saw 4 Animals bubble net feeding and Nick managed to ID several Whales. What a trip!! Thank you Nick.        Produced with CyberLink PowerDirector 13.\n\nTo find out more about issues faced by Whales & Dolphins check out Marine Connection \nhttp://marineconnection.org/",

If all things go right, Cindy and I will be on the Silver Bank to film and document these gentle giants with  Tom Conlin of Aquatic Adventures. \r\nThe Aquatic Adventures Team collectively has 386 weeks of know-how in approaching, working and interacting with humpback whales of the Silver Bank. \r\nA soft-in-water encounter is not scuba diving, nor is it aggressive swimming or free diving. It is passive, non-aggressive floating at the surface, in mask, fins and snorkel, allowing the whale to develop an interest in humans. It is finding a cooperative, tolerant and/or curious whale and meeting that whale in the water, calmly and peacefully, permitting a rare and treasured encounter between human and cetacean. Through 20 years of experience these methods have been proved to generate the best, closest and most numerous encounters. © Tom Conlin\r\n\r\nAquatic Adventures\r\nP. O.

    "original": "Download Brian Jeffrey music at:  \nhttp://www.cdbaby.com/Artist/BrianJeffrey\nThis beautiful Whale video was shot by song writer and producer, Brian Jeffrey, along the central coast of California and features giant Humpback Whales, nearly landing on sea kayaks, boats and paddle boarders. The scenic video features an original song by Brian Jeffrey called, \"You're Talking Again\", which serves as the perfect back drop for these breathtaking images of whales, otters,dolphins and birds in a wild feeding frenzy that lasted for one week in August, 2012. Watch the showdown at the end of the video when a battle for the dock erupts between two harbor seals. It's hilarious!\nThis video is a must see and must share!\nDownload brianjeffreymusic at http://www.cdbaby.com/Artist/BrianJeffrey\nhttp://search.itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZContentLink.woa/wa/link?path=brianjeffreymusic",

After sailing for a while, we were coming back to Santa Cruz harbor and found a large aggregation of marine life feeding on fish. Sea birds, sea lions, harbor seals, dolphins and a humpback whale were the predators. After observing the whale surfacing to breathe several times, we decided to head out. Little did we know that we will see the whale one more time except, this time it came out with its mouth opened and barely missing a paddle boarder who was coming out of the harbor. We could not believe it! He escaped danger twice by centimeters... Fortunately he is ok and we got the action on video!",

Incredibilmente entrambi sopravvissero. Tom, documentarista per professione, non smise però di pensare all’incidente che avrebbe potuto ucciderlo, chiedendosi se l’animale volesse intenzionalmente far loro del male.\nPer far luce sull’accaduto, Tom ritorna in California nel 2018, intervistando studiosi e protagonisti di esperienze da brividi, simili alla sua. Questi incontri sollevano interrogativi ancor più profondi, non solo in relazione all’accaduto. Tom si interroga sul rapporto fra l’uomo e i cetacei, e sul futuro di questi animali destinati a convivere con l’uomo.",

Toxic accumulation of substances like PCBs that cause high mortality, captivity for entertainment, starvation due to overfishing, and even the fact that in some countries they are still hunted for food, not to mention a rapidly changing ocean chemistry!

    "original": "Video from a Baltimore Sea Safari whale watching boat trip off Baltimore in West Cork, Ireland - watching Humpback whales bubble net feeding on sprats. Humpback whales have developed an unusual technique for feeding on shoals of fish, they drop deep in the water and swim around in a circle blowing bubbles. the circle of bubbles rise slowly to the surface, trapping fish in the center of the bubbles (like a curtain of bubbles), then they rise through the center of the ring with their huge mouths open scooping up all the fish contained within the ring. They usually settle on the surface of the water for a few seconds to force the water out through their baleen plates, and  to swallow the fish, before often repeating the process. This is an adult and a sub adult working together.\nBaltimore Sea Safari operate daily coastal sightseeing boat trips with whale, dolphin and wildlife watching from Baltimore in County Cork.",

    "original": "Drone footage of a great white shark and humpback whales at the Kermadec Islands, NZ's northern most territory. \nIt was just announced that the Kermadec region will become one of the world's largest Marine Sanctuary's in 2016. The sanctuary will be about 2 times the size of NZ's land mass. \nWe expected to see lots of humpback whales on their migration south to their feeding grounds in Antarctica on this scientific expedition - we didn't expect to bump into any great white sharks! One of the GWS's has been positively identified as a shark that was tagged in 2011 at Stewart Island (about 2500km south). \n\nRead about this scientific expedition here:\n\nhttp://kermadec.aucklandmuseum.com/about-expedition/2015-the-great-humpback-whale-trail/\n\nCheck out our website:  www.youngoceanexplorers.com",

    "original": "Swimming with humpback whales with Bluewater Explorer off Eua Island, Tonga. This was shot with a GoPro and the sound is as it was on the day - including my ohhhh's and ahhh's as I saw them for the first time.  This experience was a life changing one and I am so honoured that these beautiful whales were so trusting and wanted to interact with us. We swam with many different whales and each time was different and always on their terms.  If they wanted to play, they stayed. If they didn't, they swam off. What is so amazing to me is that they are so large yet so gentle and you can see how close they got to me but I always felt safe. There was one moment that baby swims past very closely, followed by Mum and Mum turns around to face me, decides that I must be okay and then rolls onto her back - within inches of me!! You can see me trying to move backwards out of their way but I needn't have done that as they know exactly where they are and where I was. Amazing experience and one that will stay with me forever!",

    "original": "Please share & subscribe! YOU MIGHT NEVER PASS THIS WAY AGAIN....   PLEASE READ THIS WHOLE DESCRIPTION ! IMPORTANT INFO INCLUDED BEFORE SWIMMING WITH WHALES.\n\nWorking on other videos of swimming with humpback whales in Neiafu Vava'u Kingdom of Tonga. \n\nWhat an amazing time it is of swimming in the Pacific Ocean alongside the humpback whales as they come to Vava'u to give birth to their calf. They swim past the island of Hunga and go off toward Fiji and other South Pacific Ocean islands along with the orca, humpback, beluga and dolphin. \n\nWe could not only swim with the whales but we were also just able to sit and whale watch from the boat. My friend Jimmy was not able to get in the water so he was fine simply whale watching from above the water without snorkeling with the whales. I shot lots of amazing video too! Whales coming up for air and splashing on their side, and going below the surface with fins up and whale tails above the water. We must have seen about 30-40 whales on a chartered boat we hired, it was a fast jet boat by Vaka Vave Charters. It was fantastic!\n\nThere are only a few places in the world where you can swim with giant whales of this earth! Vava'u Kingdom of Tonga is one, and down in Sri Lanka you can snorkel and swim with giant blue whale. But that's about it. I have heard that down in Tahiti you can swim with the humpbacks also, but i heard that it is really expensive... here in Tonga and Sri Lanka it is still not crowded and very cheap to swim with the whales, BUT, it might not be for long... AND it might not be legal for long too... ;) They may decide to one day ban it. Better do it before you don't ever get the chance to do it. :) Ya' know, carpe diem and all that stuff! ... ;) \n\nIn Tonga, there are people who schedule swimming with the whales as THE main thing they do when the come to the South Pacific islands! Every single day they go snorkeling and diving with the whales. It is all they do! :) I met two people on the flights to Fiji and that was what they did for 8 days. WOAAH! :)\n\nOn our tour we went with an amazing charter company called Vaka Vave Charter. You will find Diane and Izzy and the whole crew and blast to go with! REALLY you won't be disappointed!!!!!  The whales will be quite intrigued by you being there and as you can see they will possibly swim to you. \n\nBUT DO NOT SWIM AT (TOWARDS) THEM AND BY ALL MEAN DO NOT DO NOT TOUCH THEM!!!!!! THIS WILL GET YOU TAKEN AWAY FROM THEM QUICKLY!!!  WHALES ARE VERY STRONG AND IF THEY HIT YOU WITH THEIR TAIL OR FIN YOU CAN GET HURT BY THEM. THEY DONT MEAN TO BUT YOU ARE IN THEIR TERRITORY. SO BACK AWAY AND WATCH OUT!!!!",

    "original": "Occurred on June 8, 2019 / Santa Barbara, California, USA\n\nWe spotted multiple humpback whales and thousands of common dolphins. Right as we were about to head into the dock, my best friend Kristin spotted a humpback whale breaching in the distance. Although we knew the whale would probably stop breaching before we got to it, Captain Dave and the rest of our crew went there anyways. The whale stopped breaching but “mugged” our boat. It made several close passes, slapped its pectoral fins on the surface, and hung out next to our boat for about an hour.\n\nContact licensing@viralhog.com to license this or any ViralHog video.\n\nMake money from your videos!

    "original": "Today was one of the absolute best whale watching experiences of my life. It's been almost two full years since I've seen surface active humpback whales, and the wait was sure worth it. Hours of breaching, mugging, and pec slapping from at least 20 different humpback whales. The highlight was a single whale that literally did at least 100 pec slaps right next to the boat! Thank you to Pacific Offshore Expeditions and Captain Ryan Lawler for making today happen!\n\nPlease like, subscribe, and share!",

    "original": "While I was on a whale-watching trip out of Akureyri, Iceland in late June of 2019, a humpback whale approached our boat and began slapping his tail forcefully on the water. You can see the dramatic behavior in this video. (My apologies for the distracting wind noise — I was not equipped at the time with an external mic and windscreen.)\n\nThis may look like the whale is saying, \"Get the hell out of here!\" But research suggests this common behavior is a form of close-range communication with other whales. \n\nAmong a number of findings, the research, led by Ailbhe Kavanagh at the University of Queensland in Gatton, Australia, showed that just before new whales joined up, or an existing group split up, repetitive tail and pectoral-fin slapping suddenly increased.\n\nDon't humpbacks communicate by \"singing\" with a host of vocalized sounds? Indeed, they do. But the research also showed that both breaching — when whales hurl themselves out of the water and come crashing back down — and fin-slapping increased when it was windy. One possible reason: In windy conditions, vocal sounds could be less audible, prompting whales to switch to their own form of Morse code.\n\nThe study was published in 2016 in the journal Marine Mammal Science: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/mms.12374",

    "original": "Muscat: Rescue teams are currently being scrambled to rescue a rare Arabian Sea humpback whale, which has become entangled in a fishing net off the coast of Muscat.\n\nThe whale, which was sighted about 65km from the shore, is one of just 100 individuals of the Arabian Sea humpback whale population, which has been classified as endangered on the International Union for Conservation of Nature’s Red List, a catalogue of animals facing extinction.\n\n\n\nA joint statement from the Environmental Society of Oman (ESO) and Oman Sail was released just minutes after the whale had been discovered.\n\n“Inform all vessels to look for an endangered humpback whale that is entangled in a fishing net,” said Assim Al Saqri, acting head of communications for Oman Sail. “Its last known position was 65km east off Muscat’s coast on Friday, November 11, and is presumed to be slowly swimming southwards.\n\n“This whale is one out of only 100 individuals of the Arabian Sea humpback whale population, which are classified as endangered on the IUCN Red List, so every whale counts!” he added.\n\nResidents who sight the whale are requested to note the time, location and direction of the whale’s travel and immediately report it to the Ministry of Environment and Climate Affairs’ (MECA) 24-hour wildlife emergency hotline, on 24696333, or inform the ESO on 99855108, or through social media, and if possible, the Royal Oman Police coastguard as well.\n\n“If possible please take photographs of the sighting but maintain a safe distance of 100m from the distressed whale,” added Al Saqri. “DO NOT ATTEMPT to release it yourself as it’s a highly dangerous situation! A response team from MECA, who are specially trained, will mobilise to respond to any reports of the whale to disentangle it.”\n\n\n\nWebsite: http://timesofoman.com\nFacebook: http://facebook.com/timesofoman\nTwitter: http://twitter.com/timesofoman",

We'd been watching a breaching whale from a safe and legal distance, when the 2 whales surprised us by coming near our boat. Our motor was off and we were drifting quietly at the time. The more active of the two swam away while this one stayed and swam around and under our boat for over 30 minutes. It was incredible! This happened in the waters near Coffman Cove, Alaska on Prince of Wales Island. We were on the Inside Passage on a beautiful summer day in a 24 ft. Hewescraft. I still am in awe of the experience! I have more videos of the encounter and lots of photos. It was AMAZING!!!!",

    "original": "In order to catch the fish they prey on, humpback whales will circle a school of fish, blowing bubbles.  The fish won't swim through the wall of bubbles, so the whale will swim in smaller and smaller circles, corralling them in a vertical column of bubbles.  The whale will then swim up through the center of the column with its mouth open to swallow the fish.  One of the whales did this right next to the boat.  She started to create another bubble column (that's what this video is) but abandoned it.  The guide said that happens sometimes if they end up too close to the boat.  So this is just a bubble column.  Then you can see the whale a few seconds later swimming away.",

Looking like something out of a movie, the whale continued to breach, over and over again - much to the delight of those watching.

Thankfully, a photo confirms it all, An 80,000-pound Humpback whale swam right next to one of the kayakers in Monterey Bay while her shocked friend captured the moment. \"When I took the photo I was really scared, well, I didn't know what was going to happen to Karen. When I got back to land, I realized that was probably the best photo I've ever seen,\" the kayaker said.\nExperts say the whales are just out looking for lunch; particularly the anchovies in Monterey Bay's submarine canyon.",

No other use distribution or other manipulation is allowed without express written permission\n\nAn 40ft humpbackwhale seemsed to be stuck in a crab trap. When a 12ft boat stops a 100 meter to check on the whale, it turns out that whale is not stuck and now the whale checks out the boat!! This is extremely rare behaviour and should not be taken as an encouragement to approach whales. As per the recommendations from DFO in a zone of 400 meter from a whale boaters should slow down and keep a sharp lookout. If the whale turn up at 100 meters or less go to neutral and or cut your engine!",

    "original": "The humpback whale (Megaptera novaeangliae) is a species of baleen whale. \n\nOne of the larger rorqual species, adults range in length from 12-16 metres (39-52 ft) and weigh approximately 36,000 kilograms (79,000 lb). The humpback has a distinctive body shape, with unusually long pectoral fins and a knobbly head. \n\nFound in oceans and seas around the world, humpback whales typically migrate up to 25,000 kilometres (16,000 mi) each year. Humpbacks feed only in summer, in polar waters, and migrate to tropical or sub-tropicalwaters to breed and give birth in the winter.\n\nLike other large whales, the humpback was and is a target for the whaling industry. Due to over-hunting, its population fell by an estimated 90% before a whaling moratorium was introduced in 1966.\n\nStocks have since partially recovered; however, entanglement in fishing gear, collisions with ships, and noise pollution also remain concerns\n\nThere are at least 80,000 humpback whales worldwide. Once hunted to the brink of extinction, humpbacks are now sought by whale-watchers, particularly off parts of Australia, New Zealand, South America, Canada, and the United States.",

This unedited 7-minute clip reveals how they approached me while I am completely passive. Over time they became increasingly curious and relaxed with my presence. This encounter with a pair of dancers was the better part of three hours and as is apparent in the video they often approached headfirst within 3-4 feet of me, sticking their heads out of the water, rolling over onto their backs. The encounter with two adult humpback whales in the middle of the ocean where the water was as clear as a swimming pool is unique.\nThese images were taken under a Protected Species Licence for Scientific Research Activities Licence no. 14-04-11-3 issued by the Government of Bermuda, Department of Conservation Services",

I can only say, “You should see them.”\n\nI hope that you can feel that wonderful emotion from my video. \n\nI took this film a year before, at that time I didn’t have plan to make a film, so there is not enough video footage, but I did my best to make this film with great music. \nPlease understand and support me :)\n \nThere's location information on the end credits.\n\nIf you enjoyed this video, please hit the like button.\nIf you new here, please hit the subscribe button.\nAnd as always if you do have any comments questions or suggestions \njust leave them down in the section below. \n\nThank you very much for watching :D\nSee you later. \n \nYou can link this video URL, \nbut please don't download and upload it.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n★この動画、720pでご覧ください。\n\n皆さん、こんにちは！\n私は韓国の女優、 PADI インストラクター ソンヒョンです。 \n\nごれは2017年8月に撮ったモレア(Mo’orea)旅行動画です。\nモレアは島国フレンチポリネシアの美しい島です。\n\nザトウクジラとの出会いは本当に感動的でした。\n他のダイバーが私にどうだったか質問した時、いつも“見なきゃならない”って答えました。\n動画を見てる皆さんもこの感動を少しでも感じてもらいたいですね。\n\nエンディングのクレジットに場所情報あります。\n\nこの動画楽しくみてください。 \n楽しかったら購読ボタンも押してくださいね~\n\nありがとうございます。 ^O^ \n\n\nリンクの共有はいつでも歓迎しますが, 動画自体をダウンロードして、共有は望んでいません。\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------",

We travel to these pristine waters for the chance to snorkel with humpback whales, with a backdrop of tropical islands, caves and coral reef. \n\nWith over 17 years experience swimming with humpback whales in Tonga, photographer Scott Portelli captures incredible moments with mothers and calves, unique behaviours and the beauty of this incredible marine environment. \n\nJoin a tour to experience this for yourself at: \nhttp://swimmingwithgentlegiants.com/\n\n\nAbout Scott Portelli: \n\"I have travelled the world extensively photographing in some of the most remote destinations, including the Arctic, Antarctica, Galapagos, Azores, Africa and the South Pacific. As a wildlife photographer I have spent hundreds of days in pursuit of different wildlife and been privileged to be up close and personal with many creatures. \n\nI have spent the last decade working with Humpback whales photographing and filming their behaviour above and below the waves. I have received a number of internationally acclaimed awards with works appearing in a multitude of magazines and publications including BBC’s ‘Life’ series book and various documentaries on Australian and New Zealand Television. I have a passion for the ocean and an affinity with whales and cetaceans.\"\n\nSee more of Scott's work: \nOfficial Site: http://www.scottportelli.com/ \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/Swimmingwithgentlegiants/\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/scott.portelli/?hl=en\n\nJOIN SCOTT ON TOUR:\nhttp://www.scottportelli.com/category/tours/\n\nAntarctica underwater - diving with seals: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaZmG9x9mRg\n\nScott Portelli \nhttps://www.youtube.com/c/ScottPortelli",

They fed below the surface and spent a lot of time at the surface before fluking up and repeating the cycle, making for great looks. Several pairs of Humpback Whales curiously approached the boat while we were neutral! They surfaced right next to the boat giving us an amazing perspective of how large they really are.",

    "original": "Humpback Whales Close Encounter A close encounter with two incredible humpback whales.\n\nFound in oceans and seas around the world, humpback whales typically migrate up to 25,000 km  (16,000 mi) each year.\nHumpbacks feed in polar waters, and migrate to tropical or subtropical waters to breed and give birth when they\nfast and live off their fat reserves. Their diet consists mostly of krill and small fish. Humpbacks have a diverse repertoire of feeding methods, including the bubble net technique.\n\nLike other large whales, the humpback was a target for the whaling\nindustry. Once hunted to the brink of extinction, its population \nfell by an estimated 90% before a 1966 moratorium. While stocks have partially recovered, entanglement in fishing gear, collisions with ships and noise pollution continue to impact the population of 80,000. \n\n#Humpbackwahales #whalesantarctic #antarctica #fun #whales #amazing #animals #marineanimals\n\nVisit us at: http://funnysillyamazing.blogspot.com\n\nFollow us on twitter: https://twitter.com/FunSillyAmazing\n\nMusic Credits:\nPast The Edge Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com) \nLicensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 3.0\nhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/\n\nAll Clips used in the making of this video were licensed creative commons.",

    "original": "Mystery as humpback whale found dead in middle of Amazon jungle - News Live \nWhales,Animals\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCxXJWaaPjdySWLtEEj5k2jQ?sub_confirmation=1   A humpback whale has been found dead in the Amazon jungle miles from its natural habitat - leaving experts in Brazil baffled.  The 36 feet long, ten tonne marine mammal was discovered in the middle of the undergrowth on the island of Marajo off the Araruna Beach, at the mouth of the Amazon River.  Scientists believe the creature died at sea and may have landed in the wooded area after rough seas and high tides threw it inland, far from the ocean.  Dirlene Silva, from the department of health, sanitation and environment (Semma) said to Brazilian media Journal O Liberal: “We only found the whale because of the presence of scavenging birds of prey.      “The vultures were spotted circling above the carcass which was found hidden in the bush some distance from the sea.”  A team from Semma went to the region to inspect the remains, believed to be a 12 month old calf, and to gather information which could help to explain how the aquatic creature crash landed in the jungle.  Video taken on Friday shows the mammal splayed out in swampy mangrove surrounded by trees, with no visible signs of injury.  Biologists from the Bicho D’agua Institute have been called in to collect forensic samples to determine the cause of death.  They believe the massive animal, which measures six feet wide, was already dead when it was carried by huge waves to its unnatural resting place.      Renata Emin, the project’s president and marine specialist said: “We’re still not sure how it landed here, but we’re guessing that the creature was floating close to the shore and the tide, which has been pretty considerable over the past few days, picked it up and threw it inland, into the mangrove.  “Along with this astonishing feat, we are baffled as to what a humpback whale is doing on the north coast of Brazil during February because this is a very unusual occurrence.”  According to the expert, humpback whales are normally seen in Bahia on the north east coast between August to November. It is a well-known breeding and delivery area. Then they migrate to Antarctica to feed.      The biologist said: “Humpback whales don’t usually travel to the north. We have a record of one appearing in the area three years ago, but it’s rare.  “We believe this is a calf which may have been travelling with its mother and probably got lost or separated during the migratory cycle between the two continents.”  Researchers said as there are no clear reasons why it died, only an autopsy will determine the cause of death.  Emin added: “Depending on the state of decomposition, some information may already have been lost.  “We are collecting as much information as we can get and identifying marks and wounds on its body to see if it was caught in a net or hit by a boat.”      The scientists also plan to open up the carcass, collect samples of parasites and evidence from the muscles which will be sent to labs for disease analysis.  It’s believed the stranded animal may have been grou",

    "original": "Today was an OMG OMG OMG OMG!!! klnd of day on our Divine Dolphin Tour. First we encountered a lovely pod of dolphins right in front of the property and they played with our boat in between feeding, just so lovely. Then I wanted to show our guest the big waterfall so we went around the corner of the peninsula to Llorana, but before we could even get to the waterfall, we came upon mom and baby humpback whales at the coast. We stayed with them for a quite a while as they swam right along Costa Rica's amazing Rich Coast, then took off and saw two more whales before we came upon more feeding dolphins and mating sea turtles. As we were hanging with them I kept seeing blows and splashes off in the distance. It kept happening and I couldn't stand it anymore so left the dolphins and headed that way to find EIGHT HUMPBACK WHALES all together, several males after the female with her little baby and even some dolphins in the mix. The Mom was one of the most beautiful Humpbacks I have ever seen, almost entirely white on her underside and half way up her body. We got the SHOW OF A LIFETIME with breaching and tail slapping and all kinds of rowdiness. After a long time, the males left the female and baby and we stopped for lunch... and then after lunch caught up with the males again, now after another female and getting rowdy again and even some flipping, flying manta rays too.It was a WILD AND WONDERFUL DAY!!! Wooo Hooo!!! ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥",

Swimming with Gentle Giants takes small groups to participate in this amazing experience.\n\nJust another day on tour having amazing encounters in Tonga with http://swimmingwithgentlegiants.com/\n\nSubscribe: https://www.youtube.com/c/ScottPortelli?sub_confirmation=1\n\nAbout Scott Portelli: \n\nI have traveled the world extensively photographing in some of the most remote destinations, including the Arctic, Antarctica, Galapagos, Azores, Africa and the South Pacific. As a wildlife photographer I have spent hundreds of days in pursuit of different wildlife and been privileged to be up close and personal with many creatures. \n\nI have spent the last decade working with Humpback whales photographing and filming their behaviour above and below the waves. I have received a number of internationally acclaimed awards with works appearing in a multitude of magazines and publications including BBC’s ‘Life’ series book and various documentaries on Australian and New Zealand Television. I have a passion for the ocean and an affinity with whales and cetaceans. \n\nSee more of Scott's work: \nOfficial Site: http://www.scottportelli.com/ \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/Swimmingwithgentlegiants/\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/scott.portelli/?hl=en\n\nGet in the water with whales yourself: http://swimmingwithgentlegiants.com/ \n\nIncredible drone and underwater footage of humpback whales: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lkOK4CXnTA\n\nScott Portelli \nhttps://www.youtube.com/c/ScottPortelli",

The crew headed off to gather samples which we send to Mammal Research Institute (University of Pretoria) and Oceans and Coasts (Department of Environmental Affairs).  \r\n\r\nIt was a juvenile humpback male whale, 10.2m long. Although it was in a good condition with a thick layer of blubber, it was starting to decompose so we could not do a full necropsy. Cause of death uncertain at this point. There were some post mortem shark bites and no boat marks that were evident. The left flipper was missing but it is not possible to tell whether this happened pre or post mortem. It is possible this could be linked to a boat, but there have been no reports, and we are looking at sourcing any earlier photographs that may have been taken by the public. \r\n\r\nWe took four samples of:\r\nblubber \r\nbaleen\r\nbarnacles\r\nmuscle (a small sample, since it was hard to get to it)\r\n\r\nSee video for more information.\r\n\r\n\r\nKatja Vinding Petersen",

    "original": "We had another amazing day on-board Baltimore Wildlife Tours, on our \"Humpback Whale Search\". Among the many playful and interactive short-beaked common dolphin (Delphinus delphis), we had dozens of minke whales (Balaenoptera acutorostrata) and we did find a humpback whale (Megaptera novaeanglia), possibly 2!\n\nWe observed amazing behaviour, the humpback whale being widely known for it's acrobatic surface behaviour. Among the pectoral slapping there was also a few breaches! We were very lucky today to whitness such amazing animals right on our doorstep.\n\nThis humpback is pectoral fin slapping. This may look like the whale is waving at us but there are many hidden messages in this form of non-verbal whale communication. Females on the breeding grounds use this as a way to attract a males attention, calves practice it over and over again, or it could signal for other whales and whale watchers to keep thier distance. It is for that reason we recommend that whales are not persued at speed and are appraoched with care, allowing the interaction to be on their terms.\n\nPec slapping often makes a very loud noise as the pectoral fin, which can be up to five meters in length, lands with a mighty splash on the waters surface… 😍😍 Check out this amazing video by Conor Rowlands on one of \"Humpback Whale Searches\"\n\n#pecslap #humpbackwhale #cork #ORCireland #ORCirelandEvents #whales #communication",

    "original": "(Maui) This footage, captured by Whale Trust's research team on February 7th near Olowalu, shows a mom with her head down and pectoral fins out while her young calf circles around. The encounter marks the third time this season that the team has identified the same female humpback whale displaying the rarely observed behavior known as \"sailing.\" The behavior, in which a whale lifts its tail clear of the water for long periods of time, is common in right whale populations but less common in humpbacks. When humpback whales, especially mothers, in Maui are observed sailing it is not uncommon to observe one individual repeating the behavior pattern within and between seasons. The purpose of sailing is unknown but one idea is that it may help to regulate body temperature. \n\nHaley Robb, a Whale Trust research intern, reports, \"The cow held her fluke in the air for 7-10 minutes before floating up, backward, and then resting at the surface for approximately 5 minutes. She then repeated the sailing behavior. We stayed with the cow and calf for two hours and were unable to determine if the calf nursed when the cow was holding this position. During our time with the group, there were two occasions when the cow and calf breached. It was noted that for a least one of the occasions there were other whales within 300 yards of the cow and calf.\"\n\nWhale Trust’s research programs focus on exploring the natural communication, behavior patterns, and social organization of whales. Its founders are passionate scientists and explorers who believe that science—the quest for answers to the most intriguing questions about our natural world—lies at the heart of environmental education and conservation. Results from Whale Trust’s field research are the basis for a broad program of outreach and education that involve the public, educators, and a new generation of researchers. As part of Whale Trust's outreach, the organization hosts Whale Tales, an annual 4-day educational event in West Maui featuring presentations by world-renowned scientists, conservationists, and photographers. The 13th Annual Whale Tales is scheduled for February 15-18, 2019. Learn more at whaletrust.org, \n\nVideo: Ralph Pace, Whale Trust. NMFS Permit #19225.",

    "original": "http://www.reefari.com  Heaps of Humpbacks whales this year with some real close up encounters and even under the boat, visible on our Fish finder.  Now that's close!!  This video starts with a big Beautiful humpack whale coming up from right under the boat and was a pretty amazing sight, if you look closely you can make the whale out and watch him surface.  We've been seeing heaps of Humpback whales this year in close and out wide amongst the reef on our Mothershipping charters,  We even had them swim right up to the stern of the mothership.  Great to see.  WE also had a Minke whale swimming around the mothership at night,  First time I've seen one, although the video wasn't great as there wasn't enough light.  Humpback whale numbers seem to be coming back in good numbers with a reported 10% increase in numbers each year, and we've seen hundreds in the last couple of months.  These amazing animals are Always a bonus when out on a fishing trip.  In this age, surely we can stop whale hunting!!\nPlease subscribe with more great fishing and boating videos coming soon,\nCheers Greg\nFor some of the best fishing on the Great Barrier reef and we'll even throw in some whale watching over June to September check out our website at\n http://www.reefari.com/fishingmackay/",

    "original": "An unprecedented numbers of humpback whales off the coast of Dana Point, California, are thrilling whale watchers and boaters. Passengers aboard catamarans operated by Captain Dave's Dolphin and Whale Watching Safari have seen as many as 26 whales in a single day and up to 10 humpbacks in a single trip!\n\nHumpback whales used to be a rare sight off of Southern California. Sporadic encounters occurred fewer than twenty times a year on average. Then in 2014 sightings unexpectedly skyrocketed nearly 950%. According to the sightings logs of Captain Dave's Dolphin and Whale Watching Safari, humpback whale sightings off of Dana Point continued to climb in 2015 with increase of over 31% from the year before. And now, only six months into 2016, Captain Dave's logs show that more humpbacks have been seen this year than during the entirety of 2015. So far, sightings this year are up nearly 20% and counting!\n\nHumpback whales have migrated here from their mating and calving grounds off Mexico and Central America to feed on krill and small schooling fish such as sardines. \"I've never seen the quantity of bait that we have this spring,\" said Captain Tom Southern. Humpbacks filter up to 3,000 pounds of food per day through plates of black baleen that hang from the top of the upper jaw.\n\nHumpback whales have delighted Dana Point whale watchers with their breathtaking and playful behaviors, as seen in this video. Those behaviors include throwing their 40-ton bodies into the air (breaching), slapping long pectoral flippers on the surface of the water, surface lunge feeding, and more.\n\nFor twenty years Capt. Dave's Dolphin & Whale Watching Safari has offered year round, Eco-friendly, dolphin and whale watching excursions aboard unique, high-tech catamarans with exclusive features including Eye-to-Eye Underwater Viewing Pods.\n\n\nAll audio and video footage is copyright David Anderson/DolphinSafari.com and may not be used without permission.\n\n*****\nCaptain Dave's Dolphin and Whale Watching Safari offers daily, year-round, dolphin and whale watching trips from Dana Point, California, aboard a hi-tech catamaran sailboat with Eye-to-Eye Underwater Viewing Pods.\n\n(949) 488-2828\ncaptaindave@dolphinsafari.com\nhttp://www.dolphinsafari.com\nhttp://www.facebook.com/dolphin.whale.watching\n\n*****",

Slowly, but surely it made its way up here and the city of Rehoboth Beach notified us when they had been alerted that it had made almost landfall right here in North shores.\"\n\nOFFICIALS WILL NOW EXAMINE THE WHALE AND TAKE SAMPLES FROM IT, TO TRY AND LEARN AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE.\n\n\"DNREC is going to assist us with heavy equipment to try and remove the whale from the water and onto a good landing site, hopefully down within the state park so that we can conduct an (autopsy) and try to do determine more information about the animal, and what happened to it.\"\n\nTHE HUMPBACK WHALE IS ALREADY AN ENDANGERED SPECIES, AND ANOTHER TURNING UP ON SHORE IS A VERY BAD SIGN.\n\n\"An unusual mortality event is declared when, when a large number of a certain species is dying in a relatively short period of time. So, for us here in Delaware, this will be the 5th humpback whale in about 10 months. In addition, there were two floating in the Delaware Bays.\" \n\n\"The Ocean is killing them.\"\n\n\"Not good right?\"\n\n\"No, not good at all\".\n\nIN REHOBOTH BEACH, I'M TIMOTHY PARKER FOR W-R-D-E DELMARVA'S OWN N-B-C STATION.",

    "original": "Enjoy our show? Support it → http://www.patreon.com/thedetouristguide\n\nOn this episode we show you where to go kayaking with humpbacks on maui and take you on the best maui whale watching tour. We spend the day chasing around humpback whales and paddling around the Olowalu reef with our friends. Make sure to subscribe to continue following our Maui travel as we spend the next several months experiencing what it’s like to live, work and explore one of the most beautiful places in all of America.\n\nThe Detourist Guide To Travel is a long term travel show for the anti-tourist. We’re into experiencing what it’s really like to live, work and enjoy a destination like the locals do, not the people who visit. So, for the past several years we’ve left our home in the Northwest (Tacoma, WA) and lived somewhere new in the world from Vietnam all the way to Spain. What makes us different than the other 100 billion travel vloggers, digital nomads and backpackers on Youtube? We avoid the tourist track. No hostels or resorts. No tour guides or guide books. No souvenirs or travel clothes. We buy vehicles & groceries. We get apartments & jobs. We go slow & take our time, because if a place is worth going, it’s worth staying for a while.\n\nThe Detourist Guide To Travel Links:\nhttp://www.patreon.com/thedetouristguide\nhttp://www.instagram.com/thedetouristguide\nhttp://www.facebook.com/thedetouristguide\n\nLaura's Links:\nhttp://www.laurajeanandersonyoga.com\nhttp://www.instagram.com/laurajeanandersonyoga\n\nAlex's Links:\nhttp://www.theprofessionalamateur.net\nhttp://www.instagram.com/the_professional_amateur",

    "original": "Humpback whales migrate up to 10,000 km every year from the arctic waters up past the Australian coast land, into warmer sub tropical waters to give birth & mate, before heading back south to the arctic.\n\nHumpback whales feed on krill during the summer months, while in the arctic, Humpback whales can feed on up to a staggering 1.5 ton of krill per day! krill are a small animal similar to a shrimp/prawn. \n\nInfant Humpback whales travel with their mothers on this journey growing up to 100 pounds, (45kg) per day! it will take an infant humpback whale around 10 years to fully mature. Humpback whales can dive up to 210 meters and hold there breath for a maximum of 45 minutes.\n\nDuring the 1960s the humpback whale was nearly hunted to extinction, it is believed that there where as little as 100 single humpback whale left before hunting stopped, since that time humpback whales have slowly been on the rise again with thousands of whales now roaming our oceans.\n\nThese humpback whales where filmed off the coast of Bribie Island in October of 2017 using a DJI Mavic Pro 4K camera\n\nthis is a pod of 3 humpback whales.",

    "original": "On Sunday 1st December 2013 I was out with on a whale watching trip with \"Sherkin Sea Ventures\", which was skippered by Charlie Green.\nAt 3.15pm we arrived at an area where we spotted one Humpback Whale and some Fin Whales, about 2 miles south of Sherkin Island, West Cork in Ireland, which isn't far from the village of Baltimore.\n\nTo the great surprise and delight of those on board our boat the whale performed two breaches. The first breach occurred at 3.28pm and the second occurred one minute later at 3.29pm. I was lucky to be able to capture the second breach on camera.\nBehind the breaching whale is Sherkin Island. \n\nI made this video from the sequence of photos I took of this rare event in Irish waters.\nThe breach itself only lasted 2 to 3 seconds but I've slowed the video down and repeated the breach for a better visual effect.\n\nThe Humpback Whale has been recorded as visiting Irish waters in the past, according to the Irish Whale and Dolphin Group's Database, http://www.iwdg.ie/index.php?option=com_k2&view=item&id=2253 and has been catalogued as HBIRL 6. \n\nFor Sherkin Sea Ventures' facebook page check out https://www.facebook.com/pages/Sherkin-Sea-Ventures/193783824146465\n\nFor enquiries and booking trips with Sherkin Sea Ventures contact:\nIslander's Rest & Murphy's Pub, Sherkin Island,\nTelephone: 028 20116 \nEmail: info@islandersrest.ie\n\nWebsite: http://www.islandersrest.ie/\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/pages/The-Islanders-Rest-Murphys-Pub/173309946049306\n\nFor news, sightings and comment on everything about whales and dolphins and marine wildlife off Baltimore and the islands of Sherkin and Cape Clear, etc..in West Cork, check out https://www.facebook.com/Baltimorewhaleanddolphinwatch",

    "original": "Infinity pools are all about blurring the line between man-made and natural, and few places have a more gorgeous contrast than these ten hotel pools. From elephant spotting in the Serengeti to country-counting in the Golden Triangle, there's so much more than just swimming to do at our favorite infinity pools across the globe.\n \n1. Four Seasons Safari Lodge Serengeti (ARUSHA, TANZANIA).\nNo, this isn’t Photoshopped. It’s what happens when you build an infinity pool in the heart of Tanzania’s wildlife-rich Serengeti National Park. Herds of wild elephants frequent the pool area daily, as do wildebeests, giraffes, zebras, and other greats of Africa’s animal kingdom. And, better yet, there’s bar service!\n \n2. The Resort at Pedregal (LOS CABOS, MEXICO).\nThis beachfront beauty guarantees a front-row seat to Los Cabos, Mexico’s dreamiest shorelines. Gaze at endless vistas of sand and sea while keeping an eye out for breaching humpback whales, wave-riding dolphins, and the natural arches of Land’s End. Order a tamarind margarita from the swim-up bar and get comfy in one of the pool’s signature half-submerged lounge chairs.\n \n3. The St. Regis Princeville Resort (HAWAII, UNITED STATES).\nKauai’s multi-hued mountains, skyscraping waterfalls, rugged canyons, and sparkling bays are perhaps best appreciated by helicopter. But, on the ground, we love this 5,000-square-foot infinity-edged swimming pool for our fix of Hawaii’s most iconic scenery.\n \n4. Cape Weligama (WELIGAMA, SRI LANKA).\nAlong southern Sri Lanka’s palm-laced coastline, this all-villa Relais & Châteaux resort (named toCondé Nast Traveler's Hot List when it opened in 2015) has more than a half-dozen small infinity pools sprinkled across its 12 cliff-top acres. The most extraordinary panoramas are reserved for the main crescent shaped pool, where the pounding waves and verdant landscapes appear to collide over the horizon.\n \n5. The Joule Hotel (DALLAS, UNITED STATES).\nNot every infinity pool overlooks a remote tropical vista. One of the many eye-catching elements of the artsy Joule Hotel is the cantilevered, translucent rooftop pool, which projects over downtown Dallas. It’s often standing-room-only by noon, so arrive early to splash around this sliver of architectural awesomeness.\n \n6. Zemi Beach House Resort & Spa (WEST INDIES, ANGUILLA).\nIt’s a battle of the ultra-blues at this sleek, symmetric pool spilling over Anguilla’s hyper-turquoise Shoal Bay East. At the pool’s far end, a glass wall creates the infinity edge illusion, allowing beachcombers to peek in on the underwater action.\n \n7. Anantara Golden Triangle (CHIANG RAI, THAILAND).\nSarah Palin can see Russia from her house, but you can see three Asian countries—Thailand, Myanmar, and Laos—from this dazzling infinity pool, which perches at the international crossroads of the “Golden Triangle,” where the three nations' borders converge. And did we mention there are elephants roving the mist-shrouded hills below?\n \n8. Grace Santorini (SANTORINI, GREECE).\nWe already think that Santorini, Greece is one of the world’s most swoon-worthy spots, so imagine the ultra-romance of this infinity-edge pool tucked into the island’s whitewashed, cliffside splendor, overlooking the Aegean Sea and the surrounding volcanic seascapes (and which just happens to have the best sunset views on the island).\n \n9. Banyan Tree Seychelles (MAHÉ, REPUBLIC OF SEYCHELLES).\nStrewn with massive granite boulders and blanketed in powder-soft white sand, the Seychelles’ beaches are often cited as the world’s finest. So what better way to revel in such natural majesty than from the comfort of your private infinity pool (note: every hillside accommodation here has its own), preferably with a cocktail in hand?\n \n10. Amankila (BALI, INDONESIA).\nThe cascading three-tiered infinity pool of this legendary Aman resort on Bali’s east coast is one of the world’s most photogenic. Scale the three pools and spot the volcanic black-sand beaches below, Bali’s apex Mount Agung above, and the serene blue horizon in between.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nInformation Source & Images Credit: http://pastebin.com/YDfUU93p",

Giant Sperm Whales are the stars of the show and year-round residents. A typical Whale Watch tour may encounter New Zealand Fur Seals, pods of Dusky Dolphins and the endangered Wandering Albatross. Depending on the season you may also see migrating Humpback Whales, Pilot Whales, Blue Whales and Southern Right Whales. Kaikoura often hosts the worlds largest dolphin the Orca and is home to the worlds smallest and rarest marine dolphin the Hectors. Kaikoura also attracts the largest concentration and variety of seabirds on mainland New Zealand including 13 species of Albatross, 14 varieties of Petrels and 7 types of Shearwater.\n\nwww.whalewatch.co.nz",

This is day 9 of 22 for a friend of mine, Mike Pelayo.  Nothing like a big whale to shed light on an issue!\n\nWe went out kayaking and Mike wanted to do his pushups out on the ocean today.  Through his vertigo in the middle of a sea life thoroughfare, he was still able to do pushups!\n\nThe #22PushupChallenge was started by the group Honor Courage Commitment. They help support veterans and help raise awareness for the challenges they face with mental health. \n\nThe goal of the challenge is to reach 22 million pushups across all the people participating, whether it is 5 pushups at a time or 22 or a bunch with a group.  The tally can be seen at 22kill.com\n\nThis video is fun, but the issue is serious.  Please support our troops and look out for the veterans among us.\n\nDisclaimer: This video is exclusively managed by Caters News.

    "original": "Each year, thousands of whales migrate to Baja California Sur to give birth and mate. They normally do not recognize the dangers and are often caught in the nets of off-shore fishermen. When injured or in peril, their natural tendency is to swim closer and closer to shore, exposing themselves to even more dangers such as being stranded or beached.\nOn February 8, 2011, around 10 am, there were calls from fishermen in the area asking for help from the Cabo Expeditions team. Cabo Expeditions immediately notified the Mexican Navy. Both assembled teams and prepared their equipment ready to rescue an entangled humpback whale. Thanks to this intervention, the teams managed to release the male humpback in time. The team at Cabo Expeditions has participated in 8 rescues in the last 5 years, 7 of them successful!\nThe protection of this species and its environment is one of the main tasks of Cabo Expeditions.\nhttp://www.caboexpeditions.com.mx",

    "original": "Today was a truly extraordinary day on the water! The morning started with glass-like sea conditions and very low hanging fog that was eventually burned off by the sun, exposing all of the diverse wildlife around us. The first sighting of the trip was a slow traveling mother and calf Fin Whale pair that were being extremely cooperative, with an average dive time of 4 minutes. We moved off to a friendly nursery pod of Risso's Dolphins that displayed social behaviors such as pec, chin and, tail slapping. The nursery pod included 3 young calfs that still had fetal folds! After leaving the Risso's Dolphins, we received a report of the largest animal on earth not being too far from our current position. A very cooperative Blue Whale! Much like the Fin Whale earlier in the trip, this Blue Whale averaged a 4 minute dive time. On its final surfacing, it brought its tail flukes out of the water!",

On occasion we will have pods of Orca pass by and during the winter if we are very lucky we may see a humpback whale or two as the migrate past New Zealand from Antarctica in search of warmer shores for breeding. This July we have been lucky enough to witness 10 sightings on our daily Akaroa Harbour Nature Cruise trips....and boy have they been playful. Our skipper Julian captured this exclusive footage for us to share with you. He's been working the seas for 18 years and this July has provided him with the best sightings he has ever had during his whole career.

    "original": "Humpback whales were spotted in the waters off Hawaii for the first time this season, leading officials to warn ships and recreational boaters to steer clear of the endangered visitors.\nResearchers saw the first whale about a week ago off the small island of Niihau, near Kauai, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said in a news release Tuesday. A second whale was seen days later near Kauai's Pacific Missile Range Facility.\nHumpbacks normally arrive in the tropics in November and stay through May, while \"whale season\" goes from Dec. 15 to Apr. 15. There has been a general trend toward earlier arrivals in the past two decades, with the average in the past 10 years happening on Oct. 1, officials said. About 10,000 humpbacks winter in Hawaii each year.\n\nhttp://feeds.mashable.com/~r/Mashable/~3/znpREnxKvgI/\nhttp://www.wochit.com\n\nThis video was produced by Wochit using http://wochit.com",

    "original": "One Of The Rarest Animals In The World Makes A Surprise Appearance\n\nA rare albino humpback whale has been spotted off the Golden Coast of Australia, much to the excitement of animal lovers around the world. We know of only a handful of these magnificent animals in the entire world.\n\nInitially rumors abounded that the white whale was the famous Migaloo, an albino whale who was first spotted in 1991 and was the only known albino humpback until 2011, when an all-white calf was also spotted. Migaloo has been spotted all around Australia and even has his own Twitter page set up to track his movements and migration.\n\nThe bad news is it's not Migaloo, according to White Whale Research Centre founder Oskar Peterson, who told Australian Associated Press that it couldn't be the fully-grown adult as he was too small and white – Migaloo is said to have yellow spots and shading. But the good news is that it means there is a possibility that it's the baby calf previously sighted in 2011, who is potentially Migaloo's offspring.\n\nInitially spotted by 7 News Queensland, whale watchers and media alike flooded the area to catch a rare glimpse of this new and unknown magnificent creature.\n\nSource: IFL, AP",

    "original": "Countless marine animals frolic on the steep slopes of underwater volcanoes. In many cases, several are rare species not found elsewhere. This is in part due to the fact that plankton clings to the wall and provides the fish with food in abundance. This documentary shows several of these oases and also examines the impact dive tourism has and whether preventive measures can help to maintain them.\nNature and underwater filmmaker Rolf Möltgen undertakes dives into the mysterious underwater mountain landscapes with marine scientists from all corners of the globe. This journey takes us to Mexico, to snappers, white-tip reef sharks, Galapagos sharks and giant mantas. We visit the Maldives, Colombia and Costa Rica, where the team documents rare species such as deep sea burbots, small tooth sand tiger and dogfish sharks, in depths of more than 300 metres.\nThe eerie underwater mountain world proves: everyone plays a part in the network of life. Thanks to consistent protective regulations, it has been possible to retain the underwater diversity - especially in the unique oases of the high seas.",

You can expect to be into water 2-4 times a day, we are out on the orca field all the daylight time.\n\nWe don't use tanks with the animals, they are afraid of the bubbles and will then disappear. The animals are friendly, but we never don’t touch them or feed them. It’s not necessary to have any diving license to join our orca exp. trips, and you don’t need prior training. We do snorkeling/swimming with orcas and humpbacks.\n\nOur crew will teach you how to use the dry-suit for snorkeling. There are diving instructors onboard. The orca season is in wintertime and we use dry-suits. You can bring with your own dry-suit, but it’s possible to rent. There are dry-suits for rental in all standard sizes onboard.\n\nUSEA\nUSEA is the network for those who care about the respect of the comfort and the wild nature of marine mammals.\nApproved by scientists working in the field of marine mammals, USEA interactions are much better than enforced encounters for both diver and marine mammal.\nOn board the SULA, during ORCA EXPEDITION, guided by the best specialists you will learn with USEA techniques how to come close and interact in the best conditions with orcas and large whales.\nSuccessful USEA interaction allows you to be USEA Diver, registered in the network with an unique number. You will have your own Certification.\nOur captain Olav Strömsholm and the USEA Leader Pierre ROBERT de LATOUR are well experienced to come close to the animals, and Pierre is perhaps the most experienced free-diver in the world to be into water with the orcas with more than 5000 encounters.\n\nWHO CAN DO THAT?\nIt's not necessary to have a certification for snorkeling with the animals.\nWe use dry-suits and it’s opportunity to rent complete diving equipment from us.\nHowever, if you don't have experience with snorkeling we give you lessons when you are onboard and also using of dry-suits.\n\nHOW WE OPERATE?\nWe are at your service in realizing this expedition.\nWhen we are into the water with the animals we don't use bottles.\n\nHow many times you will be into the water with the animals depends of weather and windy conditions, but you can expect from 2-4 times or even more a day if good conditions.\nIt's opportunity to do regulary diving in the evenings after seeking orcas.

In the Hawaiian Islands Humpback Whale National Marine Sanctuary, brave rescuers risk their lives to keep the 21,000 whales living in the sanctuary safe. The sanctuary was established in 1992 to protect humpback whales in their Hawaiian habitat. Since 2002, sanctuary staff have removed more than 9,500 feet of nets, debris, scientific apparatus, and fishing line. The rescue team use a special tool called a flying knife, which is shaped like a hook and has a dull outer edge so as not to harm the entangled whales. They have already rescued 20 humpbacks from entanglement.\n\nRescuers Free Humpback Whales Caught in Fishing Lines in Hawaii | National Geographic \nhttps://youtu.be/LJEHIjeFnRU\n\nNational Geographic\nhttps://www.youtube.com/natgeo",

    "original": "Today whales were lunge feeding close to shore and to  surf fishermen. Then another whale who was much farther away gave a show, which included breaching,  pectoral fin slapping and peduncle throw. This whale went from one activity to another and I was able to film about half of it. It was rather far away, so the quality of the video is so-so. \n It could a good video to learn the difference between lunge feeding and breaching. When a whale gets its head with the mouth wide opened out of the water it is lunge feeding.  The whale is actually feeding on small fish or krill and is usually followed by birds who hope to get fish that jumping out of the water in front of an approaching whale.  When a whale leaps out of the water and falls back with a big splash it is breaching. Nobody is completely sure why whales are breaching.",

The water clarity was exceptionally clear today making it easy to see the large schools of anchovies below the surface (0:46-1:00 & 1:36-1:44).

As a wildlife photographer I have spent hundreds of days in pursuit of different wildlife and been privileged to be up close and personal with many creatures. \n\nI have spent the last decade working with Humpback whales photographing and filming their behaviour above and below the waves. I have received a number of internationally acclaimed awards with works appearing in a multitude of magazines and publications including BBC’s ‘Life’ series book and various documentaries on Australian and New Zealand Television. I have a passion for the ocean and an affinity with whales and cetaceans. \n\nSee more of Scott's work: \nOfficial Site: http://www.scottportelli.com/ \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/Swimmingwithgentlegiants/\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/scott.portelli/?hl=en\n\nGet in the water with whales yourself: http://swimmingwithgentlegiants.com/ \n\nIncredible drone and underwater footage of humpback whales: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lkOK4CXnTA\n\nScott Portelli \nhttps://www.youtube.com/c/ScottPortelli",

We filmed the pair for half and hour as they slowly made their way to toward Cook Strait. I have never seen a whale in this area before, a truly once in a life time experience. They turned up right on high water on a spring tide, makes you wonder if they knew it would be to hard to get through on a flooding tide with the 6 knots of current normally found there.",

Following a short motorcoach ride to scenic Auke Bay, you�ll board a water jet powered catamaran specially designed for wildlife viewing. Relax in the warm, comfortable, spacious main cabin, surrounded by large windows as your experienced Captain guides you through the island studded waters of Stephens Passage. Against a majestic backdrop of snow-capped peaks and glaciers, the onboard naturalist will explain the behavior and habitat of wildlife you may encounter, including humpback and killer whales, Steller sea lions, Dall�s porpoise, harbor seals, bald eagles, bears and deer. The operators of this tour guarantee you'll see a whale. If not, you�ll receive a $100 cash refund as you disembark the vessel. Don�t anticipate a refund; in the past 10+ years, whales have been sighted on every tour! To fully enjoy the sights and sounds of a close encounter with wildlife, be sure to bring a warm, rainproof jacket to wear on the topside observation deck and don�t forget your camera! Day use binoculars and a souvenir wildlife guide and map are provided, along with complimentary snacks and beverages.\n\nhttp://www.ncl.com/excursions/search?Ntt=JNU11",

    "original": "As the Gaian Road Team stepped back on dry land after our afternoon whale watching near Vancouver, the boat captain was shaking his head saying, \"You could go out every day for 10 years and never see what we saw today!\" This beautiful humpback would not stay away from our boat. She came over and played with us on and on for hour, going back and forth under the boat, around the boat, lazily floating with her nose out of the water just out of reach but seemingly begging for contact. It was so entirely amazing, and so heart touching. We wish you could have been there with us! Uploading this short video is the best we can do about that for now!",

    "original": "Tour at 13:00 Report from Hafsúlan: WHOO HOO! We sailed out today from Hafnafjörður in mirror calm seas albeit a bit of a swell today. The rain stayed off us too for most of the tour too which is always nice. After a hard and tiring couple of months of not too much to show our passengers (big difference from previous years) we finally hit the jack pot. Our first cetacean of the day was a big pod of White-beaked Dolphins maybe at least 40-50 individuals which were swimming around and under the boat leaping in the air and generally enjoying our company as we were enjoying theirs. We stayed with these for a long time until we got word from another whale watching boat about a large whale they saw yes a Humpback Whale. It was about the 14th last January we were starting to see humpbacks from Hafnafjörður so its nice to that they are starting to follow the herring (small fish they like to eat) back here. Lets just hope its the first of many to come. Fantastic day out on the water today. We will hopefully be going from Hafnafjörður tomorrow too if the weather stays good for us so come and join our tour to, cross our fingers, see these incredible majestic creatures again.",

    "original": "LEARN MORE: http://bit.ly/2y1uWZB\nSUBSCRIBE: http://bit.ly/2wEaHfQ\nThis exciting tour combines a \"whales guaranteed\" cruise with Alaska's finest wilderness salmon bake. Following a motorcoach ride to scenic Auke Bay, you'll board a waterjet-powered vessel specially designed for wildlife viewing. Relax in the warm, comfortable cabin, surrounded by large windows, as you ply the island studded waters of Stephens Passage. This area is world-renowned as a favored summer feeding ground for humpback whales. Once whales have been sighted, your skilled Captain will maneuver the vessel to allow exceptional viewing and photographic opportunities, as these graceful giants slowly arc their massive tail flukes into the air. Don't forget your camera, and be sure to bring a warm jacket to wear on the topside observation deck.\n\nThe whales are often close enough to hear them breathe! An onboard naturalist will explain the behavior and habitat of the humpback whale and other wildlife you may encounter, including killer whales, Steller sea lions, Dall's porpoise, harbor seals, bald eagles and more. The operators of this tour guarantee you'll see a whale. If not, you'll receive a $100 cash refund as you disembark the vessel. Don't anticipate a refund; in the past 10+ years, whales have been sighted on every tour!\n\nThen take a leisurely break from cruising to step ashore at Orca Point Lodge on beautiful Colt Island and enjoy a feast that includes fresh grilled wild Alaska salmon, chicken kabobs, corn on the cob, rice pilaf, coleslaw, fresh hot rolls and desserts. The lodge offers peaceful seclusion with modern comforts in a remote wilderness setting. Be sure to wear comfortable walking shoes and take a stroll along the beach before boarding the vessel for your return cruise to Auke Bay.\n\nNote:Dress warmly and bring a rainproof jacket to wear on the vessel observation deck and for enjoying the natural environment at Orca Point Lodge. Complimentary-use binoculars and souvenir route guides are provided. Participants must be able to walk a distance of 40 to 50 feet to embark and disembark the vessel.\n\nhttp://www.ncl.com/cruise-destination/alaska/overview",

It is still not clear when or how the carcass will be removed.\n\n\nFollow Louise Hartland on Twitter: http://www.twitter.com/CTVNewsLouise",

Video taken by tour guide Bastien Gueit. \n\nFrom our Whale Diary: www.elding.is/whalediary\nTour at 14:00 (Report from Skrúður). What a GREAT TOUR ! 3 SPECIES this afternoon Humpbacks, Minkies and Porpoises! We had to go again a little bit further out in Faxafloi bay, but then we got our first Humpback Whale, as well as our first Minke Whale. But the more we stayed the more Humpback whales we saw, maybe 3-4 of them, they appeared at different places around the boats as well as some minkies. Both of these species were surfacing 2 meters from the boat in front and on the right side of the boat, that the passengers could see their whole bodies under the surface and when breathing, as well as the long white pectoral fin of the humpbacks. Even a minke whale showed us its whole body.Amazing! Then to top it all, out of nowhere came out a pod of 5-10 harbour porpoises on the right side of the boat coming from under the boat. A lot of birds too : Arctic terns, manx shearwaters, plunging gannets, puffins, common guillemots, razorbills, arctic skuas, kittiwakes, gulls.",

    "original": "Эмоции зашкаливают)! Недавно вечером увидели китов прямо напротив дома. Событие не очень редкое, но киты пришли не так давно. Так что @taniaelisarieva и @hispaniolaisland схватили фотоаппараты и начали снимать. Обычно киты плывут по своим делам. Показали спины или хвосты, пустили пару фонтанов и привет. В этот раз они были почти на одном и том же месте часа два. Я думал сплавать к ним (уже пробовал не раз). Но так как до этого были сплошные фиаско не решался долго. На исходе второго часа решился попробовать. Взял снаряжение, поплыл в их сторону. Прямо перед моим входом в воду они показали спины. Туда я и поплыл. Ныряя по пути я слышал их песни, но знал, что это ничего не значит. Вода разносит звуки очень далеко. Увидел по пути тунцов, потом рифовую акулу. Решил погнаться за ней, нырнул, повернул голову и обалдел... Два кита замерли у дна на глубине всего 15 метров и не двигались. От обилия эмоций я чуть не выплюнул сердце (зря сегодня в выходной от тренировок день я все же решился выпить вкусного доминиканского кофе). Разговариваю сам с собой, успокаиваю, но все равно эмоции зашкаливают. Думал увидеть их проплывающими мимо, но не ожидал, что они будут просто лежать и подпустят меня к себе. Вода на закате уже не такая прозрачная, да и одному было страшновато их трогать (очень хотелось). Когда они меня заметили, то стали уплывать. Догнать конечно нереально, хотя я попытался. Поплыл обратно домой и сидел еще часа два в шоковом состоянии от переизбытка эмоций. Вроде бы одной мечтой меньше, но хочется еще. Жизнь удивительна, а сегодня для меня очень особенный день... 🇩🇴🌅🐳🐳🇩🇴 What a day... meet two whales near home. Still in shock... #lapreciosa_surf #surfholidaysru @heroeveryone #heroeveryone @quiksilver_ru \n#Equipment #Снаряжение: #bifins #molchanovs \n@molchanovsfreediving #molchanovsfreediving",

So we moved aboard our sailboat RAN, a custom built Beason 40 in aluminium, untied the lines in the middle of the Swedish winter, January 2016, and started sailing south along the coast of Europe.

    "original": "Whale Alert from Dana Point- Strange how things happen , Moterey Bay has been on the news about all the Humpback Whales and the friendly sightings and lunge feeding ..Sunday 7-20-14  it was kind of like a little Monterey Bay show off Dana Point, on our first trip out Capt Frank on the Ocean Adventures ( the best Whlae Watching boat ) found what he first thought was 3 Humpbacks a strange occurrence since we don't see them to often.Capt Frank then realized it was 2 humpbacks and a Fin Whale ( which later they thought to be a Brydes Whale almost the same exact looking whale ) . The Humpbacks a Mother and Calf visited us and  put on a show all day from 10am - 7pm , playing hide and go seek for a few hours we thought they had left the area but around 5pm they just showed up again to the delight of the Whale Watching passengers out with Dana Wharf. The pictures are amazing and the video too - again we also saw what we think is a Brydes Whales (another rare sighting), plus Risso Dolphins and Common Dolphin it was a great day - one everyone will remember and just think they wanted to see a Blue Whale and they got Humpbacks.  \n\nCheck out our Whale Sightings Log updated daily http://danawharf.com/whale-watching/ \n\nAll footage including drone footage is owned by Dana Wharf Whale Watching and may not be used without permission.\n\nDana Wharf is the premiere year-round whale watching company in Dana Point. Beginning in 1971 we are the pioneer of whale watching adventures in Orange County, California. \nWe interact with over 1000 whales during the Gray whale migration in the winter and view hundreds of 90 feet Blue whales in the summer. Sightings of Orca, Humpback, Sperm and Finback Whales are not uncommon.\nIn addition to whales, thousands of dolphins, sea lions, sea faring birds and even sharks are found year-round in our waters, so we always have plenty of wildlife to see.\n\nDana Wharf Whale Watching\n34675 Golden Lantern, Dana Point, CA 92629\nPhone: 1-888-224-0603\nEmail: info@danawharf.com\nWeb: www.danawharf.com\nFollow us on instagram @danawharf\nTwitter @danawharf",

From the footage there was some concern that the tail was not surfacing and may have been entangled in something as we had received reports of a possible entangled whale earlier that day. After finding the whale, the volunteers from BDMLR’s Large Whale Disentanglement Team stayed with the whale and reported that it was swimming strongly and lifting its tail above the water. There was no reason to be further concerned and so the team returned back to mainland Scotland.\n\nAnother great example of multi-agency working and a happy ending for the whale too!",

    "original": "Tour at 1300 Wow what a tour. The sea was calmer and the whales were more active and abundant. On the way offshore we saw a couple of Puffins, loads of Harbour Porpoises and once in the area we saw at least 3-5 Minke Whales, some close and some further a way and a couple of Humpback Whales, one which was amazing, lunge feeding (coming high out of the water with ventral pleats extended and mouth full of food), rolling and sometimes showing his/her beautiful tail when diving. After a while of watching this whale other boats came and so we headed away too find other whales. We went to watch a couple of Minkes and then another Humpback Whale before we headed home.\n\nTour at 0900 The weather was beautiful, sea was mirror calm and wildlife numerous. We headed out and saw 10-20 puffins scattered on our way offshore and quite a few Harbour Porpoises too surfacing quickly through the water. Then we saw a Minke Whale surfacing many times 20-30 meters from the boat. We wanted to spend most of our time further offshore where there were many species and individuals from previous days. It had calmed down a little from the last couple of weeks, less birds and less Humpback Whales but we found a pair of Humpbacks travelling together so we got a nice distance from them and turned off our engines. We had them surfacing less than a meter from our boat, circled a couple of times around us and then headed away. Whether this was to interact with us or whether there was fish beneath us or maybe both we will never know. It was incredible to watch nonetheless.",

In May, the humpbacks begin passing by Sydney on their Northern Migration, and by early August these whales have moved onto their breeding grounds up north. From July to September we have the Southern Right whales, Humpbacks and dolphins visiting the coast, not to mention the great albatrosses and other winter sea birds you rarely see anywhere else in the world. Mid to late August, to the beginning of December sees the return of the Humpback whales on their Southern migration. We have a 98% successful rate on our cruises, so we offer our whale guarantee.\n\nOn departure you will have the opportunity to also see the famous Sydney Harbour Bridge, Sydney Opera House, Fort Denison and the Outer Harbour as we travel out to the heads.

    "original": "We have been to Costa Rica and wanted to see whales there, but we only saw some fins, blows, and tails and we really wanted to see more of the magnificent creatures. So we decided to go to Canada - Vancouver island for a better chance of seeing them. We booked a whole day trip and the captain/guide was being told that there were about 30 southern killer whales in the region that you only see once a year. So we rushed to the place and we did not know where to look. They were all around us and the captain had to stop the boat because we can only sail 300 meters away from them.\n\nWhen we were watching the killer whales there suddenly was a humpback behind us, about 100m and we did not think much of it as it went under pretty fast, but a couple of seconds later it comes up a lot closer and towards us, so we got excited. The 3rd time it came up it was next to the boat, where it literally checked the boat and us humans out. Most of us looked right into his eye and he just kept going under and around the boat to look at everybody. He even showed us his belly and after 10 minutes we left.\n\nWe booked the tour with \"Eagle Eye Adventures\", that turns out to be run by dutchies. Jason a Canadian was our captain and guide that was also really impressed by this day. In total, we saw Southern and Northern killer whales, got mugged by 1 #humpback #whale and got away to close encounter with 2 hunting humpback whales that did bubble feeding around our boat. Jason said that the magic combination is Dutch, Belgian and German tourists in 1 boat haha.\n\n\n►SUBSCRIBE for more Awesome Videos : https://goo.gl/uDVc4n\n\n-----------------------\nCopyright - WooGlobe.\n\nWe bring you the most trending internet videos !\n\nFor licensing and to use this video, please email licensing(at)Wooglobe(dot)com.\n\nTwitter : https://twitter.com/WooGlobe\nFacebook : https://fb.com/Wooglobe\nInstagram : https://www.instagram.com/WooGlobe/",

    "original": "The final video of our journey through Antarctica, and today is another full day of exploring the continent!\n\nHalef started out with a polar plunge at the Akademik Ioffe cold pool, which was (happily) next to the dry sauna. Icy deck, cold water and dry sauna = a full Antarctica cruise experience!\n\nOur morning excursion took us to Danco Island, where we saw our first avalanche off in a distance. It was quite memorable, with a thundering sound. Unfortunately, we only captured the aftermath with our camera :(\n\nHowever, we saw hundreds of Gentoo penguins, which were roaming on the island. Gentoo Penguin footage was always easy to get! Some of these penguins also live on top of Danco Mountain, which was quite a climb for them.\n\nOur afternoon cruise turned into a whale watching - tons of humpback whales here in the Antarctic waters. And the highlight of our afternoon was to spot a leopard seal on top of a small iceberg.\n\nStill related to the Antarctica Marathon, we did a charity auction to raise money for the non profit organization dedicated to the penguin conservation in Antarctica. For more on this amazing organization, check out https://oceanites.org/ \n\nIf you are curious about what to wear in Antarctica, check out our post - What to Pack For Antarctica.

    "original": "Byron Bay is a seaside resort on the north coast of the Australian state of New South Wales with 4,959 inhabitants and is located on the easternmost point of the Australian mainland (Cape Byron), about 800 km north of Sydney and 200 kilometers south of Brisbane.\nThe name of the town comes from John Byron, the grandfather of the poet Lord Byron, a British captain and circumnavigator of the 18th century.\nA lighthouse built in 1901, the Cape Byron Light, is widely visible and is considered one of the main attractions of this small town. Due to the large and very long open bay Byron Bay is an ideal surfing paradise. Cape Byron is also known for whale watching as Cape Byron is regularly hit by humpback whales. The city has an alternative reputation in Australia, as many dropouts and artists have settled here. Its alternative reputation and proximity to Nimbin (45 kilometers) make it a popular destination for backpackers.\nAll pictures, sounds, music by: © shiso2012 思想会社 Shiso Productions",

    "original": "Throw Back Thursday: THE SARDINE RUN.\n\nThe sardine run of Southern Africa occurs from May through to July. Billions of sardines (Sardinops sagax) spawn in the cool waters of the Agulhas Bank and move northward along the east coast of South Africa. Their numbers of sardine create a feeding frenzy along the coastline. The run, containing millions of individual sardines, occurs annually between May and August when a coastal current of cold water heads north from the Agulhas Bank up to Mozambique.\n\nIn terms of biomass, researchers estimate the sardine run could rival East Africa’s great wildebeest migration. However, little is known of the phenomenon. It is believed that the water temperature has to drop below 21 °C in order for the migration to take place. The sardine shoals are often more than 7 km long, 1.5 km wide and 30 meters deep. These shoals are clearly visible from spotter planes or from the surface.\n\nDrawn to this mass migration is a diverse array of marine predators. These include the Common dolphin (Delphinus capensis), Cape gannet (Morus capensis), Cape fur seals  (Arctocephalus pusillus pusillus), Blacktip shark (Carcharhinus limbatus), Dusky shark (Carcharhinus obscurus) and Bryde’s whale (Balaenoptera brydei) amongst others. In addition, Humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae) are continuously encountered on the sardine run. Whilst not attracted to the sardines per se, these leviathans pass through the sardine run on their northern migration from Antarctica to Mozambique’s summer breeding grounds.",

Not real birds, but the scary ones from a movie: Alfred Hitchcock’s “The Birds.” The film was set and shot in the village of Bodega Bay, California, up the coast from San Francisco.The town is on the edge of Bodega Harbor, which opens into the bay itself -- a body of water that stretches several miles along the coastline. It begins at Bodega Head, a spit of land that’s bisected by the San Andreas Fault. It’s along a region where cold, nutrient-rich waters from deep offshore are pulled to the surface. The nutrients feed microscopic organisms that form the base of a highly productive food chain.The waters of Bodega Bay are part of the Greater Farallones National Marine Sanctuary. It protects marine life from fishing and other human activities. And the shore is protected by a network of state marine reserves.One of those surrounds a laboratory operated by the University of California. In recent years, its researchers have studied how sharks use magnetic fields to detect prey, the effects of an invasive crab species on shorebirds, and many other topics.Scientists have plenty to study in the Bodega Bay area. The waters host many species of fish, along with jellyfish, crabs, shrimp, seals, sea lions, gray and humpback whales, and many others. And yes, there are plenty of birds, too: brown pelicans, arctic loons, magnificent frigatebirds, and Hitchcock’s favorites, laughing gulls -- more than enough to put a scare into anyone along Bodega Bay.",

    "original": "As one of the largest predators to have ever lived, megalodon captures people's imagination - and for good reason. But was this apex predator simply a beefed-up great white shark, and is it still lurking in the dark depths of the ocean? \n\nEmma Bernard, who curates the Museum's fossil fish collection (including fossil sharks), helps separate fact from fiction.\n\nThe biggest shark in the world\n\nThe earliest megalodon fossils (Otodus megalodon, previously known as Carcharodon or Carcharocles megalodon) date to 20 million years ago. For the next 13 million years the enormous shark dominated the oceans until becoming extinct just 3.6 million years ago.\n\nO. megalodon was not only the biggest shark in the world, but one of the largest fish ever to exist. Estimates suggest it grew to between 15 and 18 meters in length, three times longer than the largest recorded great white shark.\n\nWithout a complete megalodon skeleton, these figures are based on the size of the animal's teeth, which can reach 18 centimetres long. In fact, the word megalodon simply means 'large tooth'. These teeth can tell us a lot, such as what these massive animals ate. \n\n￼\n\nA megalodon tooth next to a tooth of a great white shark \n\nWhat did megalodon eat?\n\nEmma explains, 'With its large serrated teeth megalodon would have eaten meat - most likely whales and large fish, and probably other sharks. If you are that big you need to eat a lot of food, so large prey is required.' This would have included animals as small as dolphins and as large as humpback whales.\n\nWe have other evidence of megalodon's feeding habits in the form of fossilised whale bones. Some of these have been found with the cut marks of megalodon teeth etched in the surface. Others even include the tips of teeth broken off in the bone during a feeding frenzy that occurred millions of years ago.\n\nOpen wide\n\nIn order to tackle prey as large as whales, megalodon had to be able to open its mouth wide. It is estimated that its jaw would span 2.7 by 3.4 metres wide, easily big enough to swallow two adult people side-by-side.\n\nThese jaws were lined with 276 teeth, and studies reconstructing the shark's bite force suggest that it may have been one of the most powerful predators ever to have existed.\n\nHumans have been measured with a bite force of around 1,317 Newtons (N), while great white sharks have been predicted to be able to bite down with a force of 18,216N. Researchers have estimated that megalodon had a bite of between 108,514 and 182,201N.   \n\n￼\n\nThe tip of a megalodon tooth is preserved in this fossil whale rib bone \n\nWhat did megalodon look like?\n\nMost reconstructions show megalodon looking like an enormous great white shark. This is now believed to be incorrect.\n\nO. megalodon likely had a much shorter nose, or rostrum, when compared with the great white, with a flatter, almost squashed jaw. Like the blue shark, it also had extra-long pectoral fins to support its weight and size.\n\n'A lot of reconstructions have megalodon looking like a bigger version of the great white shark because for a long time people thought they were related,' explains Emma. 'We now know that this is not the case, and megalodon is actually from a different lineage of shark of which megalodon was the last member.'\n\nThe oldest definitive ancestor of megalodon is a 55-million-year-old shark known as Otodus obliquus, which grew to around 10 metres in length. But the evolutionary history of this shark is thought to stretch back to Cretalamna appendiculata, dating to 105 million years old - making the lineage of megalodon over 100 million years old. \n\n'As we've found more and more fossils, we've realised that the ancestor to the great white shark lived alongside megalodon. Some scientists think they might even have been in competition with each other,' says Emma.\n\n￼\n\nMegalodon likely had long pectoral fins, like modern blue sharks do today © wildestanimal/Shutterstock\n\nA cosmopolitan shark\n\nO. megalodon was adapted to warm tropical and subtropical locations around the globe. The species was so widely spread that megalodon teeth have been found on every continent except Antarctica.\n\n'We can find lots of their teeth off the east coast of North America, along the coasts and at the bottom of saltwater creeks and rivers of North Carolina, South Carolina andFlorida,' explains Emma. This is likely due in part to the age of the rocks, but also because they can easily be found on the sea floor allowing collectors to go diving for them.\n\n'They are also quite common off the coast of Morocco and parts of Australia. They can even be found in the UK near Walton-on-the-Naze, Essex,' says Emma, although they are extremely rare in the UK and tend to be of poor quality.\n\nWhy are megalodon teeth so common?\n\nAlmost all fossil remains of megalodon are teeth.\n\nSharks continually produce teeth throughout their entire lives. Depending on what they eat, sharks lose a set of teeth every one to two weeks, getting through up to 40,000 teet",

    "original": "California’s north-central coast is famous for its natural splendor. Only fifty miles northwest of San Francisco’s Golden Gate Bridge, yet light years away from the hustle and bustle of the human world, lies a magical underwater island few people have ever heard of.  \n\nProtected inside a National Marine Sanctuary, the Cordell Bank is a hotspot for marine life. Cold, nutrient-rich waters welling up from the deep fuel the base of the marine food chain in the region, which in turn feeds birds, sea turtles, and marine mammals who travel from thousands of miles away. \n\nAnd while the sanctuary is actively protecting local resources, it still faces global stressors that might threaten the area in the future. Scientists are actively studying the potential impacts of ocean acidification and lowered dissolved oxygen levels caused by climate change. \n\nLearn more at https://www.changingseas.tv/season-11/1101/",

    "original": "March 2019 was another month of significant extreme weather events, with record-breaking flooding, hailstorms, snowfalls and wildfires - on every continent, no matter the season.\n\nWhile the media hypes the pseudo-scientific claim that climate change is man-made and whose effects should really only concern future generations, HERE AND NOW the climate is shifting - and, besides mitigating some of its effects, there is nothing governments can do to prevent this shift from happening.\n\nAmong the 'highlights' in March were catastrophic flooding in the US Midwest after a 'winter hurricane' inundated much of the US with snow and rain. Nebraska was especially hardest hit as two-thirds of the state became an inland sea. Of the multiple powerful cyclones in the southern hemisphere last month, one caused unprecedented flooding in southeastern Africa and killed 1,000 people.\n\nHuge dust-devils, 'snownados', 'thundersnow', and deluges of hail and rain occur with such regularity now, they're practically 'normal'. The same goes for spectacular meteor fireball events, which - after a decade of not seeing them - even the mainstream media reports on these days.\n\nAll that, and more, in this month's SOTT Earth Changes Summary...\n\nMusic used: 'Escape from the Temple' by Per Kiilstofte. Licensed under Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International \n\nTo understand what's going on, check out our book explaining how all these events are part of a natural climate shift, and why it's taking place now:\n\nEarth Changes and the Human-Cosmic Connection: \n\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Earth-Changes-Human-Cosmic-Connection/dp/1897244975/",

One of the best places on earth to see whales.\n\nIsland of Sri Lanka is not only a place to see thousands of elephants, or hundreds o them at once, but it is a place to see the largest whales in the world. Along its coasts, the blue ocean is full of dolphins and whales. The whale watching season in Sri Lanka runs from November to April / May, as during the rest of the year, the waters will be too rough because of the Monsoon. One of the best places is Mirrissa Beach, a small tourist town that is also a very hospitable place to visit.

    "original": "Blue whale sighting off Balboa Island  in Orange County California.  This blue whale is estimated to measure  65 feet. \nBlue whales are the largest animals ever known to have lived on Earth. These magnificent marine mammals rule the oceans at up to 100 feet long and upwards of 200 tons. Their tongues alone can weigh as much as an elephant. Their hearts, as much as an automobile. Blue whales reach these mind-boggling dimensions on a diet composed nearly exclusively of tiny shrimplike animals called krill. During certain times of the year, a single adult blue whale consumes about 4 tons of krill a day. These graceful swimmers cruise the ocean at more than five miles an hour, but accelerate to more than 20 miles an hour when they are agitated. \n\nYouTube \nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCjTBBaWcz5zNKVPf4nDYhTA/videos?view_as=subscriber",

    "original": "#Utria\n#Choco\n#BahiaSolano\nWhite island is located in Utria National Park, about 17 Km from El Valle Corregimiento, part of municipality of Bahía Solano.\nThe island is owned by ancestral native families, the entire business is 100 percent controlled by locals. \n\nThat is also a plus finding a place where no foreign businesses exist. \nThe beauty of the place clearly can be seen in this drone footage. The surroundings of this island are pure, full of virgin forest just in front of Utria National Park, just in the main entrance of the Ensenada.\nTo arrive here, just contract a motorboat. They usually charge you about US $40 per person road trip. \n\nIn the place, a typical meal may cost about US $ 10 and you may choose rent snorkels to dive, and see the natural coral reef full of color fishes, sea stars, and even coral snakes. \n\nEvery single penny worth here so it may be good leave a tip if you feel you were trait properly.\n \nThe Utría National Natural Park (Spanish: Parque Nacional Natural Ensenada de Utría) is a national park in the Chocó Department, Colombia. It contains diverse flora and fauna in a lush, mountainous rainforest environment with some of the highest rainfall in the world, \nat up to 10,000 millimetres (390 in) annually. The park also protects the coastal marine environment, and is known for visits by humpback whales, who give birth in the lagoon after which the park is named, \nand sea turtles who nest on the beaches. There is accommodation for visitors, and ecotourism services are provided by the local indigenous people and members of the coastal Afro-Colombian communities.\n\nThe park was created in 1987. It has an area of 54,380 hectares including the protected marine and land areas. \nElevations range from 0 to 1,400 metres (0 to 4,593 ft) above sea level. \n\nThe park covers part of the Baudó mountains. The Condoto, \nCondotico and Valle rivers and the Mundúquera stream originate in the park.",

    "original": "We were swimming with humpback whales, when we saw a family of 3 whales. Mother, calf and the male escort who protects the mother and calf. The mother invited us to come play with them by showing us the calf and slapping her tail to the surface for good 10 minutes. We went in and saw the whales from behind, when the calf turned around to come meet us. The mother followed and in front of us they took a sharp turn, and thats where I almost get hit by her tail.\n\nThis humpback is around 40 tonnes and 18m long, so getting hit by her powerful tail will not be a good thing.\n\nWatch and see how close a call this was!\n\nHowever an amazing experience, and the whales intend no harm to humans. They are very intelligent animals who sometimes love to play and interact with humans. Gentle giants who deserve to be protected like any other whales.",

    "original": "Surprising winter Humpback Whales and dolphins! We found at least 10 Humpback Whales, lunge feeding, and several hundreds of Pacific White-Sided, Northern Right Whale Dolphins, sea lions and birds engaged in a multi-species feeding frenzy on a massive bait ball of anchovies. This is very unusual for winter months which is the season for daily sightings of migrating Gray Whales. The good news is the Humpback Whale population has increased in size from 400 about 30 years ago to close to 3,000 now! We identified as many whales as possible by their distinctive fluke patterns to determine which whales are spending the winter off our coast. Most Humpbacks are in their breeding grounds off Mexico currently and will return to our coast during March and April. It’s also inspiring to find large schools of anchovies in our area now. The Humpbacks and dolphins have been around over last few months and represent the most sightings during any winter in over 30 years of our observations. These whales have been feeding on the outer coast west of Monterey to Pt Lobos often beyond the canyon edge. \nSubscribe to our YouTube channel for more HD videos: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCk6zKJqyD0j4e05nLZ0B53w?view_as=subscriber",

After spotting the whales, they began moving, changing their course and heading straight toward us.  We abided by rules by not \"engaging engines\"/paddling while the whales were close... they just kept coming closer.  We hadn't paddled for about 3 minutes before this encounter happened.  \n\nI have complete respect for these whales and their safety.  I've been working alongside these humpbacks professionally for years...these ones just happened to really want to come and say hi.\nThis is the closest I've ever been after literally 1000s of whale encounters.  \n\nThe calf was playing and splashing around, and the pectoral fin slaps and fluke slaps were from a competition group of adult whales vying for dominance and the role of the new escort... those signs of aggression directed towards other whales, not kayakers 100 yards away.  We just happened to be in the direction they chose to go.\n\nPretty incredible!!\n\n**To use this video in a commercial player or in broadcasts, please email licensing@storyful.com**",

    "original": "From the biggest of sharks, to the smallest of fish, join us as we explore 11 of the friendliest sea creatures in the world!\n11. Whale Shark\nYou might be surprised at first that a shark is on this list. But here's why, it's because despite what Hollywood tells you, not all sharks are \"evil\" or hunt humans on a regular basis (or come out of tornadoes but I would hope that one was obvious...). Some sharks only attack when provoked, and some don't even attack at all. Which brings us to the Whale Shark.\n10. The Nurse Shark\nOk, I know. If you look up the Nurse Shark, you'll see that it's No.4 on the list of creatures most known to attack humans. That's because quite simply...the humans deserve it. In its natural habitat, the Nurse Shark is truly one of the most docile sharks around. 9. Fish\nWhat? This is a fair entry! I know there's a lot of fish in the sea (pun intended!) but I'm talking about the hundreds and thousands of species of little fish that are in the oceans that can't hurt people at all. The ones that fill the aquariums at your local pet store, those fish! \n8. Jellyfish\nOk, I know what you're thinking, \"You convinced us about sharks, but Jellyfish sting! I've watched Finding Nemo!\" And yeah, Jellyfish can be jerks at times and are infamous for having the natural defense of stingers that can be used to ward off predators or other creatures that have gotten too close to them. Which definitely includes humans.\nThat being said, there are species of Jellyfish that don't have stingers. . If you don't believe me, look up a place called Jellyfish Lake. It's in the Rock Islands of Palau. \n7. Manta Rays\nIf we're being honest here, Mantas are a really cool sea creature. Not the least of which is because of their size (which can get up to 20+ feet in length at their max), shape, and their rather indifferent nature when it comes to humans approaching them. They're totally chill about the prospect of people randomly showing up in their waters.\nUnlike their Sting Ray brethren, Manta Rays don't have a means of actually hurting people short of ramming into them. ...which they could do if they wanted so don't tempt them!\nThere are tourist destinations in the Bahamas, the Cayman Islands, Spain, the Fiji Islands, Thailand, Indonesia, Hawaii, Western Australia and the Maldives where you can go into the water and just watch the Manta Rays swim around and enjoy life. It's one of many popular tourist destinations involving sea creatures.\n6. Sea Turtles\nWhen you think about a turtle, you're likely thinking of the kind you'd have as a pet. Calm, docile (unless it's a Snapper) and...well...slow. In the oceans of the world, the Sea Turtle doesn't necessarily have the slow part, but they do have a calm and relaxing attitude towards life. And they're so calm that they'll let humans actually grab onto them via their shells underwater and then actually go swimming with them. \n5. Manatees\nManatees are very much the \"gentle giants\" of the oceans. They are well-loved for their rather calm demeanor. And it doesn't hurt that they're slow-moving and can't exactly run away from humans per se/ It's incredibly easy to go up to one, pet it, and then swim with it for a while should you have the urge. .\n4. Sea Otters\nWe've had a lot of creatures on this list that may not be deemed as \"cute\" by some people, well that ends now! Because the Sea Otters have arrived on the list! And honestly, we should be grateful that they like us at all given that we've hunted them for centuries.\n3. Orca Whales\nYep, you knew that Shamu would be on this list. And sure enough, they're close to the top! Which is interesting because at one point in time, Orcas were known strictly as \"Killer Whales\", and nothing else. This was because of their incredible hunting abilities (which are really impressive, especially when they hunt as a group) and there were \"sightings\" of Orcas killing humans. But there have been no fatalities in open waters via Orcas.\n2. Humpback Whales\nWhile the Orcas may be one of the most known whale species in the world, there's no doubt in many people's minds that the friendliest whale in the oceans today is the Humpback Whale. Which has its own interesting history with humans as they were almost hunted to extinction. For real. At one point in time, 90% of the population had been killed by humans until a ban came around to stop the madness. They're still protected to this day despite their numbers recovering.\n1. Dolphins\nI mean...was there anything else that honestly could've been put on the top of this list? Think about it. They're dolphins! They're what a lot of people go to see at aquariums, they love to do tricks, show off, and they'll even let people get up close and kiss them (should you be into that...). What's friendlier than that?\nAdd to all of that, there's their natural ability to protect life, specifically, protect human life. Plus...there was this film named Flipper...",

    "original": "WHALE WATCHING IN HAWAII\n\nThis was an unplanned encountered with the Hawaiian native spinner dolphins. These are the smallest dolphins. We luckily encountered a MEGA pod--meaning more than 150 dolphins.\n\nGoing back to Maui, We saw another rare event and spotted some humpback whales. the come to Hawaii to give birth and raise their calves during the warmer weather of summer. This gives the calves to learn how to swim and grow before travelling thousands of miles back to Alaska.\n\n#whalewatchinginhawaii #humpbackwhales #Spinnerdolphins\n\nAffiliate link to Skyroam unlimited international data that helps avoid roaming charges & provides internet connection: http://www.skyroam.com/?rfsn=698834.0....

One of the first Christian settlements in Baja California Sur that dates back to the 17th century. \n\nAnd all of this spiced up with great Mexican food and good company: our tour is guided as usual by Marine Biologist who will share even more information than usual. \n\nI mean...if this in not the trip of a lifetime...what else is out there better than this?\n\nWe run this trip only ONCE a year and the best month is MARCH!  There's only 8 spots available as we want groups to stay small.\n\nMore about the schedule and the tour on our website: \nwww.cabowhaletrek.com\n\nContact us if you have any doubts or questions!\n\n--------------------------------\n\n\nCabo Trek your BEST option for \"Whale Watching in Cabo San Lucas\" !\n\nhttp://www.cabowhaletrek.com\n\n-----\n-----\n\nWhale Watching season in Cabo San Lucas starts the 15th of December and ends the 15th of April of each year! \nScuba diving and Snorkeling? all year round!\n\nCabo Trek focus is to provide excellent customer service, our boats are new and comfortable, shade is provided as well as a marine toilet.

    "original": "¿Qué harías si te encuentras nadando cerca de la orilla del mar y, de repente, un animal salvaje comienza a nadar hacia ti? ¿Cómo reaccionarías si el animal es gigantesco, con muchos dientes afilados y con una muy mala reputación? La mayoría de la gente nunca más se sentiría segura en el agua. Hay muchos animales que dan miedo en el mar, pero estos son los animales más amigables que jamás hayas encontrado. Vamos a sumergirnos en las profundidades del océano en busca de las criaturas marinas más amigables alrededor del planeta.\r\n\n9 Nutria Marina\r\n\nLos primos más pequeños de esta criatura suelen ser los que ves en el zoológico. Las nutrias de río son pequeños mamíferos del tamaño de un perro pequeño y a menudo son vistos jugando a las escondidas entre ellos o arrojando su roca favorita. alrededor del mundo se encuentran diferentes especies de nutrias y la nutria marina es la especie mas grande de todas. Pero, ¿sabias que las nutrias marinas ni siquiera viven en el mar?\r\n\n\r\n8 Manatí\r\n¿Alguna vez has visto una sirena fea?  \r\n\n7 (TN) Manta Raya\r\n6 Tiburón Port Jackson \r\n5 Medusa De Palau \r\n\n4 Delfines\r\nHay muchos relatos anecdóticos de delfines que salvan a las personas de los tiburones e incluso de delfines más grandes como las orcas conocidas como \"ballenas asesinas\". Pero los delfines hacen mucho más por los humanos que ser salvados de ser cena. En realidad, pueden tener poderes curativos ...\r\n\n3 Tiburones Blanco\r\n¿Y si te dijera que el Tiburón de la película podría ser tu mejor amigo? ¡Imagínate nadando en el océano y de repente un gran tiburón blanco viene a saludar! \r\n\n2 Tortuga Marina\r\n1 Ballena Jorobada\r\n\n\r\nAll audio provided by audioblocks.com provided under the following license agreement. https://www.audioblocks.com/license\r\nall video provided by audioblocks.com provided under the following license agreement.\r\nhttps://www.videoblocks.com/license\r\nSome material was utilized under a CC0 public domain designation “Courtesy: NOAA Fisheries”\r\n\nThe material credited in the link below was used, some with modifications, with rights provided per the publishing of said material under a CC-BY license.

    "original": "A second mass whale stranding in three weeks occurred Friday on Southwest Iceland’s Reykjanes peninsula. The stranding happened on the rocky coast of Garður, the northernmost town of the peninsula, after 50 to 70 pilot whales were spotted close to shore near high tide. \n\nOne of the first responders on the scene at 19;00, police officer Hjálmar Hallgrímsson said there was an attempt to push the whales out to sea. “As soon as high tide hit [at 19;30],” Hjálmar told The Grapevine, “they all just sailed right onto shore.”\n\nMore than 50 whales were stranded close to the breakwall. Police were joined by Björgunarsveit, Iceland’s volunteer Search and Rescue Team. Whale rescue was ongoing throughout the night, with 30 whales successfully rescued and returned to sea before 8;00 Saturday morning.\n\nRead the full article: https://grapevine.is/news/2019/08/03/mass-whale-rescue-iceland/",

    "original": "Our Best Travel Destinations for Snorkeling\n\nWe fully expect and hope that this list isn’t exhaustive, but we are really excited to share our favorite destinationsthe best snorkeling in the world so far!  We have included destinations from the Galapagos Islands, the Philippines, Panama and Egypt.  Our travel choices are heavily biased towards places with th best snorkeling spots as it’s our favorite thing to do, so all of these destinations are places with world class snorkeling.  We also prefer places with great off shore snorkeling, that allows us to explore the area by ourselves without the restrictions of taking boat trips with big groups.  So that’s said, here are our best snorkeing spots (so far!).\n\nProbably our top choice for overall mind boggling nature variety is Galapagos Islands.  This place is very difficult to beat for a nature lover, it really has everything and doesn’t have to be crazy expensive, which is what most people seem to expect. In a future post we will include a detailed description of our itinerary as planning a trip here that doesn’t break the bank was not so straight forward, but it was definitely worth it!\n\n We really were overwhelmed by the richness of the wildlife in the Galapagos islands,  the best parts are in the sea, but they really would knock your socks off!  You can enter the sea from pretty much any of the 4 inhabited islands (Santa Cruz, San Cristobal, Isabela, and Floreana) and be blown away by enormous ancient green turtles, super playful sea lions and the odd passing reef shark or eagle ray.  The remaining uninhabited islands (there are 9) are very strictly controlled and can only be visited with a naturalist guide, which is absolutely as it should be.   We visited almost all but the most remote islands and were met by the pristine wildlife on each one.\n\nEgypt was our most recent and surprising trip, and this is probably our top pick for easy access to great snorkeling.  We went there with hope of seeing the elusive dugong, which we did, plus so much more!  We have a more detailed review of this trip in another video, please check it out.  To summarize, dugongs, dolphins, and turtles (both green and hawksbill!), beautiful coral and we were only there for a relatively short trip!\n\nThe Philippines is our top choice for beautiful coral, cast away beaches and stunning views. We had so many great experiences here and in addition to beautiful landscapes it boasts its fair share of cool animals one the land and in the sea.  Our main aim in the Philippines was to see whale sharks, we decided to forego a trip to Oslob, which is where alot of whalesharks are seen,  because of concerns about inethical feeding of the whalesharks which is interferring with their natural feeding and breeding cycle.  Instead we started our trip in Donsol,  which is regulated by an excellent whale shark protection program and we delighted to see 4 whale sharks!  These guys had been firmly at the top of our bucket list for a while so it was glorious to finally meet one, it was also one of our most exhilarating trips.  We were straining our eyes to see one in the distance and swam over in the slightly murky water, to suddenly see one the size of a double decker bus almost barge into us!  You cant get much more exciting than that!   In the Philippines we were also lucky to see many turtles in brilliant visibility in Apo Island and Balicasag and even spotted the super endangered and super cute Tarsier in Bohol.\n\nPanama is a destination super close to our heart as we went there for our honeymoon.  Its probably our favorite destination for overall happy travel vibe, mixed with pockets of truly wild locations.  In Panama we got our first good look at Humpback whales from a boat in Pedasi, this is was super exciting as at one point we were on a tiny boat with Humpbacks coming up for air all around us.  There was a great variety of accessible nature in Panama, there is jungle with lazy sloths sleeping in the trees, right next to world class snorkeling in the Coiba Marine park which is teaming with reef sharks and Hawksbill turtles. Despite all of this, our real highlight was staying in a jungle lodge called Howlers bay, where a family of Racoons broke into our room at night and rummaged through our clothes (admittedly they may have been encouraged by the trail of crackers we left at the door).  If you want a nature holiday with a party vibe, Panama is the place for you!\n\nThanks for reading, please visit our blog at https://www.undervisionpro.com for more stories of our travels and updates about where we thinkg are the best snorkeling destinations in the world! Please leave us a comment with your own nature travel recommendations, we would love to hear them!",

    "original": "Join us during our 4-day trip to El Valle in Chocó, a neighbouring town to Bahia Solano, Choco, Colombia, to see the humpback whales during their mating season along Colombia's Pacific coast. During our stay at The Pelican House Hostel we did an amazing humpback whale watching tour with one of the local guides from the town of El Valle, as well as being part of a baby turtle release with a local project for turtle conservation. Due to predators - and formerly human activity and cuisine - baby turtle eggs are always at risk in Chocó, so this project collects recently laid eggs, to protect them ahead of hatching. Once hatched, tourists can learn about the project and the 5 varieties of turtles that can be found in El Valle and the Choco region of Colombia and help release the baby turtles into the sea for the first time!\n\nThe Pelican House is set on Playa El Almejal, a beautiful stretch of black sand beach with plenty of rocks, waterfalls and secret beaches ars you walk down. It is also a good spot in high tide to catch some surf - not that you can tell from our skills.\n\nWe were so excited to do a whale tour in Choco and was the first time we've seen a new part of Colombia for a while. The humpback whales blew us away during our whale tour in El Valle, Choco, swimming up extremely close to the boat as we sat with the engine off, bobbing around in the swell of the sea. The whales in Choco were an incredible thing to see for us\n\nFor more info on how to get there and what to do in El Valle, Bahia Solano, Choco:\nhttps://cuppatocopatravels.com/colombia/el-valle-whale-tours-bahia-solano-colombia/\n\nCheck out our other videos on YouTube or find us on Facebook/Instagram @cuppa.to.copa.travels\n\n\nMusic: Ikson - Remember\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DnwQYI_VycM\n\n\nKeywords (please ignore!):\nWhale tours choco, whale tours colombia, whales colombia, humpback whales colombia, whales bahia solano, whales el valle colombia, el valle choco colombia, bahia solano choco colombia, turtles colombia, turtle release choco, baby turtles colombia, baby turtles choco, baby turtles bahia solano, turtles el valle choco, parque nacional utria, playa el almejal, utria national park, Tour de ballenas choco, tour de ballenas colombia, ballenas colombia, ballenas jorobadas colombia, ballenas bahia solano, ballenas el valle colombia, el valle choco colombia, bahia solano choco colombia, tortugas colombia, liberacion de tortugas choco, tortugas bebes colombia, tortugas bebes choco,tortugas bebes bahia solano, tortugas el valle choco, parque nacional utria, choco colombia guide, choco guide, choco vlog, choco colombia vlog, bahia solano guide, bahia solano vlog, choco 2019, nuqui 2019, nuqui vlog, nuqui whales vlog, el valle colombia vlog, el valle colombia guide, el valle colombia whales, choco 2019 guide",

Humpback whales migrate from Alaska to Hawaii every year from December to April, the majority of the population spends their time in the Maui Nui Basin, mating, birthing and resting in the warm tropical waters. Maui's waters became a protected sanctuary in the 1990's, giving the humpback whales protections including not approaching them closer than 100 yards and no swimming or snorkeling with the whales. These protections help humpback whales in Maui enjoy a reasonable undisturbed vacation in Hawaii.

    "original": "Yesterday was an exceptional day on the water! We started the morning out with several Humpback Whales including one with gorgeous white tail flukes. There were also Pacific White Sided Dolphins and Northern Right Whale Dolphins that swam together and exhibited some social behaviors. As we left the dolphins we got a report of Killer Whales several miles away. As we arrived, the Killer Whales were exhibiting some courtship or mating behavior and the \"pink floyd\" made several appearances (as seen at 54 seconds into the video).",

    "original": "Southern Mozambique is one of the top 10 scuba diving locations in the world, home to large populations of whale sharks, manta rays and humpback whales. Our marine conservation volunteer project is focused on the long term conservation of these vulnerable ocean giants. \n\nVolunteers gather research data on a diverse range of small and large marine creatures, to gain a full understand of their ocean ecosystem.\n\nThe goal of the project is for marine conservation volunteers to consistently gather data on ocean megafauna, to keep the national whale shark and manta ray databases current. You will collect population data, tag and measure animals, monitor environmental conditions, take id photos and record behaviour. Marine volunteers will also monitor coral reefs and work in the mangrove forests, plus log dives and analyse camera traps. \n\nThis is an exciting way to contribute to marine conservation, learn to dive, or improve your diving, and live in one of Africa's most beautiful and remote coastal locations.\n\nBecome part of this project: https://conservationtravelafrica.org/projects/marine-conservation-programmes/marine-conservation-mozambique/\n\nKeep up to date:\nWebsite: https://www.conservationtravelafrica.org\nFacebook: www.facebook.com/conservationtravelafrica\nInstagram: www.instagram.com/conservationtravelafrica\n\nSign up to our newsletter - http://eepurl.com/b3zEz5",

    "original": "Known as the refuge for polar bears, the Arctic Ocean has no reason to blush for its beautiful surface of 14 million km². The packed ice covers its surface and can reach up to 4 meters thick. Unfortunately, the gradual melting of ice due to global warming is a phenomenon that is becoming increasingly important in the territory. It is estimated that, in less than 50 years, the waters will be fully navigable and the guardian of these places, the polar bear, will be in danger of extinction. Winter temperatures can reach -50 ° C. 400 species of animals and more than 165 species of wild plants populate this icy environment. Many diving cruises are organized, especially on the island of Spitsbergen, where seals, belugas, whales, penguins, birds but also small fish can be observed along icebergs:. All in a magical setting with sumptuous panoramas!\n\n\nArctic Ocean\n\nThe Antarctic Ocean\nIn 4th place for its largest surface of water on the planet, is the Antarctic Ocean with an area of 20,327,000 km² and depths of up to 5,000 meters! The waters are extremely cold, between -2 and -10 ° C and are not very salty. The melting of the ice cap is also an alarming phenomenon on the territory. The subject is at the heart of current debates on environmental issues. Its importance and preservation are paramount for the future of our planet Earth. Its own circumpolar current is the most powerful in the world. It has the particularity of absorbing hot currents and redistributing cold waters, making it a key player against global warming. For a diving cruise, you will be completely cut off from the world in Antarctica. The only noises you will hear will be those of the wilderness. Diving or snorkeling trips are done all year round along the glaciers. You will be able to cross endemic species, seals, leopard seals, sperm whales, humpback whales or penguins. The colors under the ice are beautiful. Alas, little flora is growing here. Some lichens, mosses and algae grow in these waters.",

Lograré mis propios videos de orcas. Siguiendo los pasos del biólogo Michael Bigg que dedicó su vida al estudio en estas aguas de los diferentes tipos de orcas; Orcas residentes y orcas transitorias.\n\nAdemás, en esta Poty Ambientura entenderás:\n- La diferencia entre focas y leones marinos.\n- Cómo surgió el nombre de \"Orcas\"\n- De dónde proviene el apodo de \"ballenas asesinas\"\n- Qué tipos de orcas se están descubriendo en la actualidad\n\nYa conoces el canal, educación ambiental fresca y entretenida.

However, because blue whales and gray whales migrate at different times of the year, whale watching season in San Diego is open year round.  Blue whales migrate from mid-June through September. Blue whale calves will be swimming beside their mothers for the return migration in the spring.\n\nSo our hope was to see a Blue whale, and it turned off a blue whale was seen 2 days before on July 4th, so we were excited....unfortunately there were no blue whales on this day\n\nBut we did see the 2 minke whales and a whole lot of dolphins!\n\nOur tour operator was San Diego Whale Watch and we recommend them when looking for a tour operator.  sdwhalewatch.com",

    "original": "Strongest creatures in the world! From an animal that has a bite so strong it can cut through metal wire to one that can lift the equivalent of six double decker buses  \r\n\r\n\r\n7. Blue Whale\r\n\r\nThe world’s largest animal is the blue whale. They can grow to be over 100 feet, and weigh as much as 150 tonnes. Blue whales are found in every ocean on the planet and have been known to eat as much as 40 tonnes or 400,000 krill - small shrimp-like creatures - in one day. Blue whales have made our list due to the sheer muscle strength they generate. The two groups of muscles they use to swim are the epaxial muscles for the upstroke and the hypaxial muscles that power the downstroke. By measuring a cross-section of these two muscles, scientists are able to measure the ratio of force per unit area of muscle or “muscle stress.” One whale weighing a mass of 70,800 kg - that’s about 70 tonnes - was able to produce a maximum force of 60 kilonewtons, and that’s considered a small whale. A blue whale’s jaw will open to nearly 90 degrees as it is eating, which slows it down from about 9 miles per hour to about 3 miles per hour. \r\n\r\n6. Black Piranha\r\n\r\nWhile piranhas get a bad reputation in the cinema for being malicious frenzied eaters, the truth is further than you think. These omnivorous fish live primarily in the South American rivers, lakes, and reservoirs and rarely feast on unsuspecting swimmers. They have triangular teeth, much like sharks, that are serrated. The jaws of a black piranha are one of the strongest in the world. Scientists have put this fish to the bite test and found that the bite force of the black piranha is around 70 newtons. That’s a force that is more than 30 times the small fish’s body weight. That’s more than a great white! Scientists use pounds per square inch or PSI and a measurement called newtons, the force needed to move 1 kilogram 1 meter per second, to measure the bite force of various animals. Megapiranha paranensis, an early ancestor to the modern piranha, had an estimated bite force that ranged between 1,240 and 4,749 newtons. The fish itself was only about 10 kg or 22 lbs - that means its bite force was roughly 50 times the animal’s body weight. That means, pound for pound, these ancient fish were able to bite with more force than even the megalodon shark.",

    "original": "The Makapu‘u Point Lighthouse Trail Hike was a cool hike. It's toally paved, so it's easy to accend. Once you get to the top, you can kinda jump the fence and keep going. It's a great adventure!\r\n\r\nMakapu‘u Point Lighthouse Trail Hike\r\nAddress: Waimanalo, HI 96795\r\nHours: Closes 6:45PM\r\nPhone: (808) 587-0300\r\n\r\nTrail Length: 2.0 miles (round trip)\r\nActivity: Pedestrian\r\nDifficulty:  Moderate\r\nTerrain: Hot, Dry Slopes\r\nElevation Gain: 500 ft\r\n\r\nNatural hiking area with paved trail & overlook, ocean views, lighthouse & whale-watching potential.\r\n\r\nThe Makapu‘u Point trail, within Kaiwi State Scenic Shoreline, offers outstanding views of O‘ahu’s southeastern coastline, including Koko Head and Koko Crater. From the trail’s destination at Makapu‘u Head, one is rewarded with magnificent views of the windward coast and offshore islets, as well as the historic red-roofed Makapu‘u Lighthouse built in 1909, which makes a stunning picture against the deep blue sea below (the lighthouse itself is off-limits). On a clear day, you may even see Moloka‘i and Lana‘i. The offshore islets are wildlife sanctuaries for Hawaiian seabirds, such as the ‘iwa, frigate bird, and tropicbird. This trail is an excellent place to view migrating humpback whales in season (November – May). Binoculars are suggested for viewing the whales and seabirds. An interpretive sign and viewing scope along the trail help you view and identify the whales seen from this location.\r\n\r\nThis portion of the island tends to be hot and dry and the vegetation includes low-growing kiawe and panini (cactus). The trail is exposed and is usually sunny and hot. It can be very windy at the summit. A hat, sunscreen, and plenty of water are recommended. Give yourself about 2 hours to enjoy this hike and it’s wonderful views.\r\n\r\n\r\nVideo Title: Makapu‘u Point Lighthouse Trail Hike - Best Hawiian Hikes (Waimanalo, HI)\r\n\r\nVideo File Created Date: Friday, April 12, 2019 (Video may or may not have been captured on this date, it shows the date the video was last converted.)\r\n\r\n-- Video uploaded and managed using YouTube Bulk Uploader for the Lazy!\r\n-- Manage and Auto-Tag your YouTube videos offline...

    "original": "Come and experience California’s year-round whale fest!\nFrom the far north to the Mexican border, California’s pristine waters play center stage to much-loved visitors such as humpbacks and orcas, as well as gray whales, who follow the entire coast on their yearly migration. \nCalifornia is one of the best places in the world for whale watching. Each year, about 20,000 gray whales make an epic 6,000-mile journey between Alaska and Mexico—and then back again. These massive, itinerant mammals travel from feeding grounds in the Bering Sea to mating and breeding lagoons along Baja California in Mexico. It’s one of the most amazing wildlife migrations on the planet, and also relatively easy for humans to witness, especially if you join a guided whale-watching cruise with knowledgeable crew on board. (In some locations, you can see whales spouting, breaching, and fluking from ocean bluffs, especially if you have binoculars.) While gray whales get the spotlight along the California coast, other cetaceans—including orcas, humpbacks, porpoises, dolphins, and gigantic blue whales—ply the waters at different times of year, bumping up your chances of seeing something amazing out there in the sea.\nCalifornia is one of the few places where you can see whales year-round. From San Francisco in the north to San Diego in the south, these giants of the deep migrate up and down the coast, providing humans with one of the greatest shows on Earth. It’s easy to spot passing whales with the naked eye from California’s many points which jut out into the Pacific Ocean, however, nothing comes close to the thrill of seeing these majestic beasts up close out on the water. The most common species in Californian waters are gray whales, which make an astonishing 10,000-mile (16,090-kilometer) round trip each year between their feeding grounds in the Arctic and the warmer breeding and calving lagoons of Mexico. Off San Francisco and Monterey Bay, humpback and blue whales appear year-round, while blue, sperm, beaked, minke whales and orcas appear seasonally. \n\n1. Eureka\nLocated on the shores of Humboldt Bay, Eureka, CA is the largest coastal city between San Francisco and Portland. Outdoor recreation is abundant, with activities like boating, sport fishing, kayaking, and whale watching all available close by. To see the whales from the water, charter a boat or take a kayak tour out of Trinidad Harbor. There are also countless sites to whale watch from land. The best ones are located high on the cliffs of Shelter Cove, Sinkyone Wilderness State Park, Patrick’s Point State Park, and Table Bluff.\n2. Mendocino\nThe quaint, coastal village of Mendocino is a beloved whale watching destination. There are plenty of great lookout points in the area, including Point Cabrillo Lighthouse, Point Arena Lighthouse, and Mendocino Headlands State Park. You can even whale watch at the annual Whale Festival in March. It’s a wonderful event that features whale exhibits, educational lectures, and delicious fare from local restaurants.\n3. The Bay Area\nThe waters bordering San Francisco are a seasonal hotspot for whale migrations. Humpback whales, blue whales, and gray whales have all been spotted here. The Oceanic Society offers full and half-day guided tours to the Farallon Islands, and San Francisco Whale Tours provides whale watching adventures year-round. It’s always a good time to visit!\nThe Washington Square Inn is ideally situated in San Francisco’s legendary North Beach neighborhood. It’s just a short cable car ride from Fisherman’s Wharf, Pier 39, Coit Tower, China Town, Union Square, and Telegraph Hill. No matter where you end up, the inn’s friendly staff is dedicated to making your vacation as comfortable and relaxing as possible.\n4. Monterey\nThe Monterey Submarine Canyon in Monterey, CA, is a deep water canyon system that provides many benefits to year-round whale watching. Killer whales use the canyon as hunting grounds throughout the year, and humpback whales, blue whales, and a variety of dolphins and sea lions feed here in the summer months. Visitors can charter a boat out of the wharf for an up-close look at these incredible species.\nBlue whales are the largest mammal ever known to have lived on Earth. They can stretch up to 100 feet and can weigh more than 200 tons. Can you just take a second to imagine what that looks like to see a whale of that size spouting out air and water some 9 meters in the air? Envision this massive creature appearing on one side of your little whale-watching boat and popping up on the other. Realize how it could tip you into the water if it wanted to. And when you go whale watching in California? You don’t even have to imagine. You’ll have the chance to see this living giant, along with a host of other creatures, in real life. \n\n\n\nMore Video * Mirissa whale Watching Boat Tours - https://youtu.be/-SsYjf2imzY",

    "original": "On April 13th 2019 I went on an eight hour whale watching cruise with Monterey Bay Whale Watch on the Sea Wolf II. We saw a gray whale near the harbor as we headed into the open bay. Next, we sighted a pair of humpbacks who were feeding on krill accompanied by red necked phalaropes. Next we saw several black footed albatrosss feeding on a dead squid. Afterwards, we travelled with several thousand Risso's dolphins and several dozen pacific white sided dolphins who socialized and played with a young humpback whale. We then headed south and found the CA140B pod of California transient orcas. This pod is composed of CA140B, a young adult female orca and CA140B1 and CA140B2, her two young daughters. They recently split from the CA140's as Emma's pod was getting a bit crowded.",

    "original": "In this video we travelled to the Bazaruto Archipelago in Mozambique and experienced the most breathtaking views, snorkelling, island life and fishing. \n\nLynton Kennard fishing guide and owner of “Island Excursions Moz” guided us to an unforgettable experience in and around Vilanculos and Bazaruto, while we stayed at the friendly and well equipped Casa Chibububo Lodge! Lynton’s 30 plus years of experience as a professional hunter and fishing guide showed to be invaluable to us on this trip.\r\n\nHelena caught this delicious queen mackerel with live carapau we caught just before we spotted the queen mackerel. And what a delicious eating fish the queen mackerel is!!\n\nThere are many “paradise” islands around the globe. The Bazaruto Archipelago is one of them. A patch of paradise forming a prominent attraction along the long stretchy unspoilt beachfront of the Mozambican coastline. Bazaruto is without a doubt a world class destination captivating connoisseurs with its endless and deserted white beaches, blistering dunes, crystalline turquoise warm waters, breath-taking sunsets, thriving marine kingdoms, freshwater crocodiles and exceptional fishing. \r\n\nThe Bazaruto Archipelago consists of five idyllic islands: Bazaruto, Benguerra, Magaruque, Santa Carolina and Bangue island. Formed by the Save River depositing sand, which has since shifted its course. The archipelago as well as the coral reefs surrounding the islands was proclaimed a National Park in 1971 making it one of five official marine protected areas in Mozambique.\r\n\nBoasting with diverse ecologies there is an abundance of reef fish, sea turtles, game fish and devil rays, freshwater crocodiles and even Suni. A number of endangered marine mega-faunas, such as Whale Sharks, Manta Rays, Leatherback Turtles, Cetaceans including Humpback Whale and the Dugong, are also found in the Archipelago. The Dugong population specifically are approximated at 120 individuals and form the largest population of Dugongs along the eastern coastline of Africa, south of the Red Sea. Globally Dugongs are ranked as vulnerable by the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species.\r\n\nComing to the community of the Archipelago there are around 4000 residents on these islands of whom 70% directly depend on fishing and fishing-related industries as a primary livelihood and base for economic and social development.\r\n\nThis experience was not just memorable for its great fishing, exploring, snorkelling and filming the islands, but also the welcoming solitude it offers.\r\n\nBazaruto certainly stood up to its reputation as the 'Pearl of the Indian Ocean' and ‘a Gift to the Earth’!!\r\n\nThank you for joining us on this adventure.

    "original": "Sea Shepherd, with support from the Aeolian Islands Preservation Fund, is protecting the Mediterranean waters of the southern Tyrrhenian Sea through a direct-action campaign against illegal fishing: Operation SISO. \n\nTen volunteer crew onboard a catamaran and RHIB -- both equipped with a new hoisting system – were able to confiscate 20 illegal FADs (Fish Aggregating Devices) and 42km of polypropylene twine within the first 47 hours of their six-day undercover patrols around the Aeolian Islands.\n\nOperation SISO is conducted in cooperation with the Naval Operations Department of the Financial Police (Guardia di Finanza Sezione Operativa Navale), the Milazzo’s Coast Guard, the much-welcomed collaboration of artisanal fishers, and the volunteer assistance by Orchestra Conductor Roberto Soldatini, who used his own sailboat to help locate illegal FADs during the first three days of the campaign. \n\nFor more information visit: https://bit.ly/2MrRdX6 (Italian) or http://bit.ly/2Ps74Xy (English).\n\n----\n\nSea Shepherd is an international, non-profit marine conservation organization that engages in direct action campaigns to defend wildlife, and conserve and protect the world’s oceans from illegal exploitation and environmental destruction.\n\nLearn more about us: https://www.seashepherdglobal.org/\nSupport our efforts: https://www.seashepherdglobal.org/donate/",

Es por ello que retuiteó una carta dirigida al presidente Martín Vizcarra, donde pide que su gobierno apruebe la primera zona protegida del mar peruano.\nEl actor estadounidense siempre se ha manifestado a favor del medio ambiente.\n@presidenciaperu @martinvizcarraperu, creating the Nazca Ridge Marine Protected Area will be your powerful legacy and secure the future of the Peru’s ocean abundance for generations to come.\nRight now, less than 0.5% of Peru’s maritime territory is under legal protection, far from the 10% goal to which the government committed to achieve by this year. More than 1,000 species can be found in the Nazca Ridge, including blue whales, humpback whales, orcas, marine turtles, sharks and tuna. It is also home to deep-sea species such as cold-water corals and cod. By protecting this area, we can help maintain its abundance for generations to come and in turn, ensure neighboring fisheries thrive.\nJoin @Oceana @oceana_peru in urging Peru’s President Vizcarra to create the Nazca Ridge Marine Protected Area and have his action celebrated at the UN Ocean Conference in June. Visit OCEANA.ORG/NazcaNow.\n\n#Peru #LeonardoDicaprio",

    "original": "Offering 360º views out over the harbor and port of Icy Strait Point, the North Star is a one of a kind new feature onboard the Ovation of the Seas. Built as a glass gondola on the end of a 135 foot long crane it is capable of lifting 14 passengers vertically to a height of over 300 feet. Raising guests high above the ship the gondola rises to it's maximum height before making a slight rotation to both the port and starboard side to ensure everyone gets a good view regardless of where they are standing. While capable of holding the gondola over the side of the ship for unique view the Quantum Class no longer uses that mode to save time and increase the hourly capacity.

    "original": "Charlotte is a new mother cow who has just given birth to her first ever little bundle of joy. She lives on a beautiful farm near Millbrook, Ontario. The farmers here are committed to treating the animals in the best manner possible. They refuse to raise veal for ethical reasons, and they place herd health and happiness ahead of profit. The cows roam free over rolling acres of meadow. They have forested areas, lush, green grass and wildflowers, and ponds full of fresh water to drink. The calves enjoy running and playing in the sunshine alongside their mothers. There is even a large bull named Gus who wanders among the herd, keeping a protective watch over all of the others. The farmers keep a close eye on things from their farmhouse atop the hill and everything here runs smoothly. Life for these beautiful creatures is as close to what nature intended. Charlotte has chosen a quiet spot up on a hill, away from the rest of the herd, and she lay down near the forest to deliver her baby. Gordie is a very robust calf who looks just like his father, Gus. Gus is a 2,000 pound black bull who is a proud father of all the calves born here. Gordie lay in the grass while Charlotte licked and cleaned him. This is an important part of the bonding process, as well as an important step in getting Gordie cleaned and free of blood and afterbirth that would attract predators and insects. While she is working away at this, Linda, a seasoned mother who has had several few calves of her own comes over to check Gordie. She is curious about the little fellow and she also seems to be giving Charlotte her approval as she inspects him and then grazes nearby. Gordie eventually gets to his feet and takes his first wobbly steps, a heart warming moment to see. He stretches adorably and then makes his way around Charlotte. Eventually, Gordie will nurse and get milk and antibodies from his mother. He needs to grow strong quickly to keep up with the others. Ethical farms like these are not hard to find. Supporting farmers who do things right is an easy choice, and although it costs a little more to buy from these farms, it ensures that the animals get the treatment that they deserve.\n\nSource & embed code: https://rumble.com/v843c0-charlottes-calf-takes-his-first-wobbly-steps-while-linda-looks-on.html.\n\nFor licensing, please email licensing@rumble.com.",

    "original": "Humpback whales live in oceans all around the world. They have one of the largest migrations patterns of any mammal & they travel miraculous distances every year. Inspired by their long and wing like flippers, the scientific name Megaptera meaning “large-winged,” was given to the Humpback. Humpbacks are about 50-60 feet long, roughly the size of a school bus! They are known to live up to the age of 80-90 years. These creatures are well-known for their vocalizations. This “singing” covers many octaves that includes frequencies that even humans can’t hear. Unfortunately whales fall victim to ghost fishing, and some nations still allow whaling. We propose to create the worlds largest marine preserve to help save these majestic creatures.\n\nLearn more about our organization by visiting our website.\nwww.SavingOceans.org",

The third clip which shows the tuna going through the school in the upper right was shot just off of Le Count Hollow, Beach in Wellfleet, MA. \n\nMoosh Systems is a company committed to the development of the most advanced aerial imaging system for shark detection the world has ever seen. In the process of collecting data for our AI system we have managed to capture some amazing footage over the waters of Cape Cod. We hope you enjoy.\n\nhttp://www.mooshsystems.com/",

At one point the whales surfaced within feet of the bow! Luckily, our accompanying researchers from Planet Deep had their new Mavic Pro 2 (drone) high above to capture this footage.\n\nThis encounter took place during a 12-day private expedition aboard the luxurious El Aleph organized by Oceanic Society in partnership with Planet Deep for a group of friends from the United States. Beyond daily snorkeling, our expedition had an onboard whale expert. A portion of our days is spent looking for, identifying, and monitoring cetaceans to help better understand how whales use the waterways within Raja Ampat.\n\nFor upcoming travel opportunities aboard El Aleph on Raja Ampat, see https://www.oceanicsociety.org/expeditions/banda-sea-reefs-blue-whales-and-hammerhead-sharks--1965\n\nVideo captured by Planet Deep / Johannes Hennicke.",

It reports rebounding sea life, from humpback whales off Australia to elephant seals in the US and green turtles in Japan. Through rampant overfishing, pollution and coastal destruction, humanity has inflicted severe damage on the oceans and its inhabitants for centuries. But conservation successes, while still isolated, demonstrate the remarkable resilience of the seas. The scientists say there is now the knowledge to create an ocean renaissance for wildlife by 2050 and with it bolster the services that the world’s people rely on, from food to coastal protection to climate stability. The measures needed, including protecting large swathes of ocean, sustainable fishing and pollution controls, would cost billions of dollars a year, the scientists say, but would bring benefits 10 times as high. However, the escalating climate crisis must also be tackled to protect the oceans from acidification, loss of oxygen and the devastation of coral reefs. The good news, the scientists say, is a growing awareness of the ability of oceans and coastal habitats such as mangroves and salt marshes to rapidly soak up carbon dioxide and bolster shorelines against rising sea levels.“We have a narrow window of opportunity to deliver a healthy ocean to our grandchildren, and we have the knowledge and tools to do so,” said Prof Carlos Duarte, of King Abdullah University of Science and Technology in Saudi Arabia, who led the review. “Failing to embrace this challenge, and in so doing condemning our grandchildren to a broken ocean unable to support good livelihoods is not an option.”Prof Callum Roberts, at the University of York, one of the review’s international team, said: “Overfishing and climate change are tightening their grip, but there is hope in the science of restoration.“One of the overarching messages of the review is, if you stop killing sea life and protect it, then it does come back. We can turn the oceans around and we know it makes sense economically, for human wellbeing and, of course, for the environment.”The review, published in the journal Nature, found that global fishing is slowly becoming more sustainable and the destruction of habitats such as seagrass meadows and mangroves is almost at a halt. In places from Tampa Bay, Florida to the Philippines, the habitats are being restored. Among the success stories are humpback whales that migrate from Antarctica to eastern Australia, whose populations have surged from a few hundred animals in 1968, before whaling was banned, to more than 40,000 today. Sea otters in western Canada have risen from just dozens in 1980 to thousands now. In the Baltic Sea, both grey seal and cormorant populations are soaring.“We’re beginning to appreciate the value of what we’re losing and not just in terms of intrinsic beauty of the wildlife but in terms of protecting our livelihoods and societies from bad things\n\nAll data is taken from the source: https://www.theguardian.com/\nArticle Link: https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/apr/01/oceans-can-be-restored-to-former-glory-within-30-years-say-scientists#img-1\n\n#review #columbiadailyherald #tesfanews #news #nytimes #cnn #newsnow\r\n\r\nOceans can be restored to former glory within 30 years, say scientists: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBzhmCsj5cI",

    "original": "It was late in the season and the winds were iffy in the far North of KwaZulu-Natal. The windows for quality surf were becoming fewer and even more far between. We'd spent days and nights at Zag HQ, hunkered over our computers analysing the patterns on Windy. Digger, our guide and masterful boat captain was getting fidgety. Maybe we'd have to delay the long-held plans to explore this hidden corner of coast for some undefined future date...\n\nWe've been scoping the region for a few years already. The main attraction being that you can blitz up from Durban smash two days of truly perfect tropical surf and be back in the office with a smile on your face, salt in your ears and a bit of sunblock still on your nose. Carrying stiff shoulders and a bit of fatigue into the rest of your week. \n\nFinally, the window opened, just a crack, spring lows in the morning, two days of gentle winds, mainly in an offshore direction and most importantly, a pumping East Swell. Two frothing surfers in Davey van Zyl and Saxton Randall, ready to drop everything in a 'surfer's minute' and hit the road, a vehicle, a tank full of petrol and a videographer in the form of Michael Veltman. We made the call in the morning, finally managed to collar the surfers (we had to wait for Davey to come back from a night training flight before we could bail), then shop for supplies, and we finally made the open road by 10pm. \n\nA few short few hours of kip, then up at 5 to greet the day on the beach, pile all the gear into Digger's rubber duck and weave through the stiff lines on the boat launch and out into the open sea. This stretch of coast is wild, dolphins are the locals but there are plenty of humpback whales, turtles and signs of gamefish everywhere.\n\nAnd the waves... well there were some of those. Watch the full edit below for proof. And the good news is... this swell wasn't even perfect. A little too straight to properly wrap around and rumble through the Cove. Which can only mean one thing... We'll be back to explore this amazing region at the next golden opportunity. \n\nNow sit back, relax and enjoy Zag's almost perfectly executed strike mission to Digger's Cove!\n\n\n*Big thanks to VANS for pulling the trigger with us to make it happen.",

A study released today (October 2) in Methods in Ecology and Evolution describes a way to estimate the mass of whales from images captured by drones. \n\nLed by Fredrik Christiansen from the Aarhus Institute of Advanced Studies in Denmark, researchers used photographs from drones to take body measurements of 86 southern right whales (Eubalaena australis) near Península Valdés, Argentina. The team then developed a model to predict body volume from these measurements. They used data from historical catch records to predict volume and calculate whale density, and from there, estimated body mass of the whales they observed. \n\nRead more at the-scientist.com.\n\nCredit: FREDERIK CHRISTIANSEN (2019)\nVideo was taken under research permit.",

    "original": "Humpback whales are one of the most beautiful and awe-inspiring animals on the planet. They are majestic and enormous, creating an appreciation for how small and fragile humans are in comparison. Being lucky enough to see one in the wild is an unforgettable experience. It is only then that we can fully grasp how massive and powerful they are. But actually swimming beside one is a thrill that cannot even be described. Weighing as much as 30 tons (27,000kg) and reaching 52 feet in length (24m), they are among the true giants of the ocean. These lucky swimmers had traveled to The Kingdom of Tonga, in the South Pacific Islands, to see the animals close up. Part of a tour with a certified guide, they carefully slipped into the water to observe this mother and her baby from a distance. They couldn't believe their good fortune when the mother turned and lazily drifted towards them for a closer look. Humpbacks are curious and very tolerant of humans but they are usually more reserved when they have a newborn. This mother seemed unconcerned as she and her baby closed the gap and looked at everyone closely. The swimmers moved back a few times, as required, keeping a respectful and safe distance. Their fins appear in the video as they swim backwards to move away. It is for the benefit of the animals that closer contact is avoided, and also for the safety of the people since humpbacks are powerful and heavy. It appears that this mother might have been providing her baby with a lesson in how to inspect the strange creatures that can be found in the water and she repeatedly drifted right to them. For almost ten minutes, floated and turned, moving very slowly in the direction of the swimmers. Mother humpbacks come to Tonga to give birth because it is one of the few places in the ocean where killer whales do not go. Humpbacks fear only large sharks and killer whales, and their babies are vulnerable to both of these predators in the first few months of life. The mother keeps her calf close to her head and she will lift it out of the water to protect it if a threat appears. The baby instinctively knows that this is where it should be but it swam around and rolled a few times as if tempted to play with the humans. Humpback whales are also one of the most intelligent creatures on earth, having an intellect comparable to dolphins and chimpanzees. Until as recently as 100,000 years ago, it is believed they were the smartest of all creatures on our planet. Looking onto the eyes of one of these beautiful whales, it's not hard to appreciate the wisdom and intellectual capacity behind their gaze. Anyone who has ever been in the presence of a humpback is simply not the same afterwards. Losing these whales to pollution, harvesting, or anything else would be tragic beyond words. Our oceans would not be the same without them.\n\nSource & embed code: https://rumble.com/v8q8kj-mother-humpback-brings-her-newborn-baby-to-inspect-delighted-swimmers.html.\n\nFor licensing, please email licensing@rumble.com.",

    "original": "THIS SHOULD BE WATCHED ON THE BIGGEST SCREEN WITH THE BEST SOUND YOU CAN GET. WATCH TO THE END WITH SOME OF THE BEST KEPT TO LAST. VOTE FOR YOUR FAVOURITE IN OUR POLL (OR COMMENT BELOW)\n\nA couple of years ago, Multihull Central in partnership with Cruising Helmsman Magazine (also sponsored by Wasp cam, AMS, Pantaenius Insurance), held a competition for the best short films about cruising adventures to help inspire others. We were inundated with entries and NOT from the usual YouTube sources, but from amazing armature film makers and story tellers out at sea. The following films were what the judges considered the most inspiring and represented the meaning of a seabbatical. This full collection of the best short films was first shown in a cinema that was especially hired with a packed audience at the Sanctuary Cove Boat Show and has not be seen since. \n\nDuring these times of isolation, we thought it would be great to revisit these amazing moments of inspiration to remind us of the great adventures that can be had around the world and keep planning for the future. \n\nSo sit back, get some popcorn, put it on the big screen, turn up the volume and enjoy the show. And don't forget to vote for your favourite film in our POLL at the very end, or comment below.",

    "original": "Cabo Trek your BEST option for \"Whale Watching in Cabo San Lucas\" !\n\nStarting from SEASON 2019/2020 Cabo Trek wants to be innovative and offer whale watching from a new location: SAN JOSE' DEL CABO\n\nThis decision has been made because after our research it is our believe that we can offer a great experience to our guest.\nWe believe that we will be able to find more lonely whales, meaning that there will be fewer boats around!\n\nBy offering 3 hour tours on board of a comfortable 35ft yacht we will be able to explore the Sea of Cortez more in depth and enjoy the spectacular acrobatic behaviors of the Humpback Whales.\n\nThe vessel is equipped with big roof cover for plenty of shade and of course it has a spacious restroom. \n\nSurely a good option for guests who already stay in San Jose' del Cabo or for families or generally for people who prefer bigger boats.\n\nAs usual the tour will be guided by a Marine Biologist who will amaze you with a great deal of information and curiosities. After already 3 full years of research studying the whale tails there is so much we already know about the Humpbacks who visit Baja California every year!\n\nJoin us in this NEW whale watching in San Jose' del Cabo adventure!\n\nhttp://www.cabowhaletrek.com\n-----\r\n-----\r\n\r\nWhale Watching season in Cabo San Lucas starts the 15th of December and ends the 15th of April of each year! \r\nScuba diving and Snorkeling? all year round!\r\n\r\nCabo Trek focus is to provide excellent customer service, our boats are new and comfortable, shade is provided as well as a marine toilet. Seats are cushioned and there is plenty of room for everybody since we keep our groups small (max. 10 people).\r\n\r\nCabo Trek your BEST option for \"High quality tours in Cabo San Lucas\"\r\n\r\n\r\nhttp://www.cabotrek.com\r\nhttp://www.cabowhaletrek.com\r\nhttp://www.cabodivetrek.com\r\n\r\nBe social, follow and share:\r\nhttps://www.facebook.com/cabotrek/\r\nhttps://instagram.com/cabotrek\r\nhttps://twitter.com/CaboTrek\r\n\r\n\r\nHave questions?\r\nTOLL FREE calls from U.S.: 1-844 851 9842\r\nFrom Mexico: 624 174 31 60 | 624 143 62 42\r\n\r\nEmail: info@cabotrek.com",

We enjoyed our whale watching adventure in Holmavik and even managed to save a few dollars by doing our excursion away from the usual tourists (westfjords)!  We visited a secret hot spring in Drangsnes, visited the beautiful waterfall, Dynjandi, and made our way to the Red Sand Beaches!  If you are a foodie, you MUST check out Tjoruhusid.  It was the best place we ate in the entire nation.  We highly recommend the Westfjords to anyone looking for the true beauty of Iceland without all the tourists.

    "original": "Five years ago today, the rogue poaching vessel Thunder was scuttled by its own crew after a 110-day high-seas chase by Sea Shepherd as part of Operation Icefish. \n\nAt the start of Operation Icefish in 2014, Sea Shepherd set out to locate and shut down illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing in Antarctica. Infamously named the \"Bandit 6\", the targets were six illegal poaching vessels known to Interpol and CCAMLR, who had previously managed to evade any law enforcement. Over two campaigns that spanned from 2014 to 2016, Sea Shepherd set the world record for the longest high-seas pursuit of a poaching vessel, removed 72 kilometers of illegal gillnets from the ocean, and successfully shut down all of the Bandit 6 vessels.\n\n----\r\n\r\nSea Shepherd is an international, non-profit marine conservation organization that engages in direct action campaigns to defend wildlife and conserve and protect the world’s oceans from illegal exploitation and environmental destruction.\r\n\r\nLearn more about us: https://www.seashepherdglobal.org/\r\nSupport our efforts: https://www.seashepherdglobal.org/donate/",

Humpbacks are best known for periodically jumping out of the water, or breaching, behaviour that has attracted throngs of people who take to the seas to engage in whale-watching.....",

It plies the rugged west coast of British Columbia and brings cultural, ecological, and gastronomic excellence to its small capacity of 24 passengers and 10 crew. This video highlights the nature of the experience, from onboard features, to wildlife encounters and cultural exchanges. Anyone curious about a small  ship experience on the dramatic west coast should watch. Maple Leaf Adventures runs three ships out of Victoria BC, Cascadia is the largest and newest, but all bring the guest up front and close to a personal coastal experience.",

O vosso sorriso e o facto de trabalharmos com animais livres é a nossa motivação e felicidade! :D\n\nEN | This is our humble tribute for a friend and a veteran whale watcher: Mr Lars Olsen :)\nHis passion for seeing whales started at a young age, when he saw a blue whale while working as a deck boy. After that he always wanted to see a blue whale again, and he sure did! Lars has seen several species in numerous whale watching trips: beaked whales, blue whale, fin whale, humpback whale, among others.\n\n\n\n#FuturismoAzores #VisitAzores #Whalewatching\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nOur websites\nhttps://whalewatchingazores.com/en/\nhttp://www.futurismo.pt/futurismo/\nFacebook - http://www.facebook.com/acoreswhalewatching\nInstagram- https://www.instagram.com/futurismoazoresadventures/\nBlog - http://azoreswhales.blogspot.pt/",

    "original": "Mazunte es una de las playas más bonitas y poco conocidas de Oaxaca. El primer día que despiertes aquí te recibirá un cielo azul, un clima caluroso y el sonido del suave oleaje.\n\nPor la tarde un cielo anaranjando te invitará a la contemplación y relajarte, lo cual es cada vez menos frecuente en otras playas mexicanas. La gente es amable, cualquiera te puede dar pistas de cómo pasartela bien.\n\nPara que te enamores más de Mazunte te presentamos algunos de sus mejores lugares para visitar.\n\n1. Punta cometa\n\nEn el extremo occidental de la bahía Mazunte se forma una media luna conocida como Punta Cometa, no solo te recomendamos que vayas a este lugar por tener acceso a algunos de los mejores amaneceres de la costa sino también porque al lugar se le considera un  lugar cósmico y energético. \n\n2.  Centro Mexicano de la Tortuga\n\nAunque no lo creas Mazunte no siempre fue el paraíso que hoy conocemos, antes era el rastro tortuguero más grande de México, hasta 1990 cuando el gobierno prohibió esta práctica. El Centro Mexicano de la Tortuga, ubicado en Mazunte, te permite colaborar con ellos en el rescate de estos reptiles con voluntariados de mínimo un mes. \n\n3. Come en la Estrella Fugaz\n\nEs considerado uno de los mejores lugares para comer en Mazunte, es admirado por sus cafés, desayunos riquísimos. Tienen un pequeño local llamado Kapricho, especilizado en ofrecer ceviches, ensalsadas y sandwiches.\n\n4. Practíca Skimboard\n\nPara los que practican los deportes acuáticos Mazunte es especial por la forma en que aquí rompen las olas. Atrévete a subirte a una tabla de skimboarding, una tabla más corta y ancha que las de surf. Para realizar esta actividad pregunta en dónde está el Mazunteskim, ellos te orientarán.\n\n5. Avistamiento de ballenas jorobadas\n\nSi tienes planeado visitar este paraíso oaxaqueño en un futuro cercano te recomendamos que lo hagas entre diciembre y marzo. Durante está temporada las ballenas jorobadas migran por las playas de Mazunte. Por lo que puedes admirar de este espectacular animal desde Cerro Sagrado.\n\nPisar la dorada arena de Mazunte, mientras el mantra de sus olas te arrulla con su vaivén de suave tonalidad turquesa será como caer un paraíso.\n\nEn Mazunte tus días transcurrirán lentamente. Te contagiarás de la pasividad del oleaje que pareciera no tener prisa para alcanzar la orilla de la playa, o del sol que calmo atraviesa el cielo hasta el atardecer; cuando la oscuridad llega muy lentamente parece que se despierta la poesía visual a su paso pues mientras la noche cae el radiante naranja del sol se oculta y comienzan a salir los grillos para acompañarlo con su canto; es una dulzura que casi podrás tocar. Los únicos testigos serán tú y las tortugas que regresan a casa.\n\nNuestra presencia Digital:\n\nwww.LugaresTuristicosEnMexico.com\n\nRedes Sociales:\nhttps://www.facebook.com/LugaresTuristicosMexico",

We park in Trevescan, a little hamlet near Lands End, walk via footpaths down to Nanjizal Bay. This walk in total is just over 2 miles.\n\nFor an annotated video and written walk instructions, please join us on Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/Cornishwalkingtrails\n\nCredit to: The book we used to help us find Nanjizal Bay is called Secret Cornwall, by Sue Bradbury.

Traveling every year along the U.S. West Coast from their feeding grounds north of Alaska to their mating and birthing lagoons in Baja California, Mexico. Once called \"devil fish\" by whale hunters, gray whales are now known as the \"friendly whale\", thanks to their amiable behavior towards boats and the inclination to bring their calves over to be touched by humans in the protected lagoons.\n\n➡️ Learn more about gray whales: https://www.dolphinsafari.com/gray-whales/\n\n*****\n🐳 Captain Dave's Dolphin and Whale Watching Safari offers five-star, eco-friendly, dolphin & whale watching experiences with award-winning customer service.\n\nLocated in Dana Point, California, the Dolphin and Whale Watching Capital of the World®.

    "original": "Hi Friends,\n\nIn this video we rent a jetski and make our way to Iguana Island and the famous La Famille Express. \n\nProvidenciales is the best place to rent Jetskis, you need to do your homework as everyone charges a different price. All of the tour operators are also charging different prices for the same tour. We recommend skilling the tour and renting your own Jetski or boat and doing the tour yourself. \n\nWe rented our Jetskis from Tropical Waves Water Sports at sapodilla bay beach and we found them to be professional and offer the best pricing. It's also a great place to relax as they have a bar, restaurant and other amenities for you to use while you are at the beach. \n\nOur website:\nwww.meghanandquincy.com\n\nFollow us on Instagram!\nhttps://www.instagram.com/meghanandquincy/\n\nWe're Meghan and Quincy,  we're high school sweethearts and just recently got married. We're from Vancouver, Canada, we sold everything we owned and left our home behind to travel full time. \n\nFollow us and we'll share our adventure and suitcase lifestyle with you!",

With their populations now in partial recovery, it is once again possible to find humpback whales around Rurutu in Polynesian waters. They congregate here between July and November to give birth to a new generation, and to mate. The newborns are prepared for a life of migration, covering thousands of kilometres every single year.\n▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬\n\nSubscribe Free Documentary - Nature Channel for free: http://bit.ly/2mFDC3Q\nFacebook: https://bit.ly/2QfRxbG\nTwitter: https://bit.ly/2QlwRiI\n\n▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬\n#FreeDocumentaryNature #Documentary #AdventureOceanQuest\n▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬\n\nFree Documentary is dedicated to bringing high-class documentaries to you on youtube for free.

    "original": "South Carolina goofyfoot vagabond Cam Richards is no stranger to wild, bucking bronco waves at Pipeline, as evidenced by last year's O'Neill Wave of the Winter contender. And on opening day at Pipe this past Monday, he managed an eerily similar ride.\n\n“It was a pretty bumpy morning,” he said. “Not too good, but you could tell there was a few — and not too crowded. So it was a good time to get out there, especially with it being the first Pipe swell. I had a bunch of bad ones before, and swung at that one last-minute — it didn’t look too good, and then I almost ate it on the drop. And then I recovered and did one big pump and it spit and I was blind for the whole wave, just waiting to get lipped in the head. And then it cleared up, and I was lucky enough to doggy door. It was super fun and looking forward to the rest of the season. Couldn’t ask for a better start.”\n\nSurfer: Cam Richards\nVideo: Nate Neal\n\n-----------------------------------\nFollow Surfline: \nhttp://www.youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=surfline\n\nBecome a Surfline Premium Member: \nhttps://surfl.in/2Cd36tF\n----------------------------------",

    "original": "We start to make preparations for leaving the Kingdom of Tonga to sail to Norfolk Island via the beautiful Minerva Reef. We’ve heard that the crayfish are fabulous on the south reef so we’re going to check it out.\n\nWe pick up a few last minute food supplies and do the final boat jobs that need to be done for the next passage.\n\nMagnus finally manages to fix the problem which is causing Izzy, the engine, to continually fill up with salt water! The autopilot clutch is fixed, yet again. We’re hoping it will make it all the way to Australia. The sails get a few stitches, hatches get resealed and Nutshell gets a big tidy up.\n\nWe know that Australia is very strict with quarantine when entering, so give Nutshell a good clean and clear out unwanted and not needed items, in preparation for Australian customs.\n\nWendy makes a new courtesy flag for our Norfolk Island arrival.\n\nOh, and we show you how convoluted the process is for finding customs to check out of Tonga!\n\nThanks for watching and following along with our adventures.\n\nWendy and Magnus\n\n\n______\n\n\nWhere are we now: \nhttp://sailingnutshell.com/where-are-we/\n\nIf you’d like to keep us moving and support us you can become a Patron for as little as $1 per month.\nhttps://www.patreon.com/lifeinanutshell\n\nBe up to date with what we’re up to and where we are.

    "original": "Ninja stealth mode. Due to it being pup season, I need to be really cautious about disturbance in the colonies. I spent the last few days developing some tools for a new technique. As the seals don’t have great eyesight, I found a large female with some netting gagging her and looped around the back of her head. It tools about 10 minutes of slow crawling to infiltrate the group and I got about 2 meters away without causing disturbance. The video doesn’t give justice to the size of the Bull that came to check me out and made me feel real small and vulnerable.... Obviously I didn’t have the luxury of removing the whole entanglement, but with it being cut the tension is off, which is instant pain relief, and it will surely fall off soon as she splashes around in the water again.",

    "original": "Releasing stress through the facility of Meditation Relaxing Music:\nMusic can have a profound effect on both the emotions and therefore the body. Faster music can cause you to feel more alert and concentrate better. Upbeat Relaxing Music can cause you to feel more optimistic and positive about life. A slower tempo can quiet your mind and relax your muscles, making you're feeling soothed while releasing the strain of the day. Meditation Music is effective for relaxation and stress management.\n\nOneVideo need to Research confirms these personal experiences with music. Search as relaxing music, meditation music, sleep music, calming music, spa music, relaxing sleep music, baby sleep music, relaxing piano music, soothing music, soft music, the honest guys relaxing music with water sounds meditation, sleep hypnosis, deep sleep music, sleep music soothing relaxation, zen music, music for sleeping relaxing sleep music, sleep music deep sleeping music, massage music, peaceful music, relaxing music for stress relief, piano music.\n\nCurrent findings indicate that music around 60 beats per minute can cause the brain to synchronize with the beat causing alpha brainwaves (frequencies from 8 - 14 hertz or cycles per second). \n\nThis alpha brainwave is what's present once we are relaxed and conscious. To induce sleep (a delta brainwave of 5 hertz), an individual may have to devote a minimum of 45 minutes, during a relaxed position, taking note of calming music.\n\n Researchers at Stanford University have said that \"listening to music seems to be ready to change brain functioning to an equivalent extent as medication.\" They noted that music is some things that nearly anybody can access and makes it a simple stress reduction tool.\n\nSo what sort of music reduces stress the best? A touch surprising is that Native American, Celtic, Indian stringed-instruments, drums, and flutes are very effective at relaxing the mind even when played moderately loud. \n\nSounds of rain, thunder, and nature sounds also can be relaxing particularly when mixed with other music, like light jazz, classical (the \"largo\" movement), and easy listening music. \n\nSince with music we are rarely told the beats per minute, how does one choose the relief music that's best for you? The solution partly rests with you: you want to first just like the music being played, and then it must relax you. \n\nYou’ll start by simply exploring the music on this website. Some may relax you, some might not. Forcing yourself to concentrate to relaxation music that irritates you'll create tension, not reduce it.\n\n If that happens, try trying to find alternatives on the web or consult counseling maintenance staff for other musical suggestions.\n\n It’s important to recollect that quieting your mind doesn't mean you'll automatically feel sleepy. It means your brain and body are relaxed, and together with your new calm self, you'll then function at your best in many activities.\n\nRelaxing Music – e.g. for studying, yoga, or to calm your mind: Use this soft and peaceful, relaxing and possibly inspiring music video e.g. as background music at work, while studying, reception while relaxing, for your yoga sessions, while reading, while gaming, reflecting, thinking, planning, or maybe while meditating.\n\nMeditation music:\nWhen you want the right music to go with your yoga or meditation practice, look no further.\n\nThis page starts with a playlist that has a tremendous selection of soothing, relaxing and calming music. Because of Eddy Tony from BPM Fitness for originally producing these videos on his YouTube channel. Following the playlist we've a set of fantastic one off videos.\n\nSleep Music:\nSOUND & MEDITATION FOR BETTER SLEEP\nSleep is an important phase of our life. We’d like it to realize a restorative rest that prepares of for the new day. The hours of sleep permit us to flush trivial worries and integrate our outer experiences so we will awaken refreshed and prepared for the challenges of the new day. \n\nSleep is super important:\nBecause sleep is so important, we'd like to organize for it to make sure that our sleep are going to be restful and effective. While the method is automatic for several, others need help to quiet their worried mind, calming anxieties, and adjusting expectations.\n\n In order that we rest our mind from our challenges and concerns also as our tired body.\nMeditation can improve sleep effective meditation is a perfect thanks to achieve this relaxation of the mind and body. Our mission is to supply this type of quality, effective meditation.\n\nStudy Music:\nNever underestimate the facility of classical. Serious music is understood for being both peaceful and harmonious, creating a relaxed and serene study environment for the listen.\n\nSubscribe OneVideo here 🙏  https://www.youtube.com/c/OneVideo?sub_confirmation=1\n\n#meditation #relaxingmusic #meditationmusic #sleepmusic #calmingmusic #spamusic #relaxingsleepmusic #OneVideo #relaxingpianomusic #soothingmusic #softmusic #music",

    "original": "Please change your life!!! Click on the link! http://youtube.com+watch=@3162039724/IaBL\nCan you afford this thing?: http://youtube.com+watch=@3162039724/orwTH\nSoftware at the best prices: http://amzn.com@3162039724/f3ANs\n\nIn less than 10 hours, the highly anticipated Bitcoin halving will be activated. But, whales seem to be taking the opportunity to dump on the market. Since Friday, bitcoin price dropped by more than 14% from $10,020 to $8,550. At its lowest point on May 10, it reached $8,100, marking a 20% decline ahead of the halving. The Bitcoin blockchain network is primarily divided into three groups: developers, users, and miners. Miners verify blocks that contain payment data using electricity and mining equipment such as high-power computing chips. When a miner verifies a block and the block then enters the Bitcoin blockchain, the miner is compensated with BTC. When the block reward halving occurs, which happens every four years, it decreases the compensation miners receive by half. Prior to the 2020 halving, Bitcoin miners earned around 1,800 BTC every day. Post-halving, miners are expected to generate around 900 BTC per day. Bitcoin is a deflationary currency because of its fixed supply of 21 million BTC. As such, any occurrence that affects the supply of BTC will inevitably have a significant impact on its long-term price trend. In theory, the halving is likely to have a positive effect on the price of Bitcoin over the next four years. Less BTC will be mined by miners, which means less BTC will be sold to the market. But, as seen in the 2016 halving, the Bitcoin price tends to drop right before and after a halving occurs. A post-halving drop happens as whales move to take advantage of rising retail demand. In April, data shows that spot volume of Bitcoin rose noticeably on platforms like Coinbase and Binance. Hence, heading into the halving, the demand for Bitcoin from retail investors is higher than in previous months. For whales, this means liquidity. Whales that hold millions of dollars worth of Bitcoin cannot sell BTC when they do not see much buying demand in the market. Whales typically wait for BTC price to rise to a local high point, and then initiate a sell-off. It is for this reason that the Bitcoin price sees a large shift in trend and a predictable cycle. In the past three months, the Bitcoin price increased from $3,600 to $10,065, by nearly three-fold. Most of the buying demand came from spot exchanges that saw record high volume in late April. Whales that accumulated in the $3,000 to $4,000 range have the incentive to sell at $10,000 where there is high liquidity and retail demand. The high price also coincided with a positive narrative in halving, similar to October 2019 when Chinese President Xi Jinping encouraged the development of blockchain technology. At the time, the Bitcoin price abruptly rose from $7,700 to $10,500 within a 48-hour span. Given that Bitcoin trading remains prohibited in China, it is difficult to state that a fear of missing out (FOMO) hit the Chinese market and retail investors bought in. \n\nAll data is taken from the source: https://www.ccn.com/\nArticle Link: https://www.ccn.com/why-bitcoin-whales-are-mass-dumping-before-cryptos-big-halving/\n\n#bitcoin #dailynationkenya #cryptocurrencyprices #cryptocurrencynews #cryptocurrencyexchange #cryptonews #cryptoexchange\r\n\r\nWhy Bitcoin Whales are Mass-Dumping Before Crypto’s Big Halving: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8YmJKMjpno",
